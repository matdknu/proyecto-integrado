1mlisrh,Government Red Tape is Blocking Our Plug-in Hybrid Trucks,5,skelectrician,2,2025-08-09T06:42:57+00:00,"After having the feds shove vehicle electrification down our throats, the only company in Canada building hybrid electric drive heavy duty trucks has been told by Environment Canada that they must cease production, because the emission controls on the diesel motors they use are considered inadequate because the motors are ""generators"" and not the means of powering the vehicle. 

These trucks have proven considerable fuel savings, they can do anything a traditional semi can do with a motor half the size, and they're designed and built in Canada with all Canadian employees. The company has never taken a dime of federal grants, subsidies, or loans.

But our federal government still turns their nose up at a homegrown solution to the problems they've created themselves, all while doling out billions to entice, with no guarantee for follow through, foreign companies to build electric vehicle plants in Ontario. The Federal government is actively trying to suppress innovation in sectors that they demand to be modernized. They don't give a rats ass about innovation, the economy, or even the environment.

I guarantee in one or two years time there will be a Brookfield-owned company building a very similar product in Ontario and these guys in BC will be regulated out of existence.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1mlisrh/government_red_tape_is_blocking_our_plugin_hybrid/,CanadianConservative,0.73,Discussion,False

I want him to implement publicly run grocery stores. I want to see people see this stupid idea in action. I want them to be disappointed as there will be, at best, 5% to 10% lower prices. I want them to witness empty shelves and organizational dysfunction.

I want this moron to try to seize the means of production. I want people to witness the capital flight out of NYC and how hard it is to actually ""tax the rich"". I want them to witness the complete collapse of NYC's books. 

We have seen a rise in support for socialism in the west. Especially in leftist places online like Reddit. Venezuela wasn't enough.

1mlba8e,Putin Tells U.S. He’ll Halt War in Exchange for Eastern Ukraine,0,84brucew,22,2025-08-09T00:07:35+00:00,"This is Big.  Forget the garbage the msm has been throwing at you.  Eastern ukraine is mostly russian speaking and majority would rather be under russia, like it or not.  Do some research on how many in the donbass region ukraine have killed since what, 2014 when the donbass declared their independance from ukraine until russia invaded(liberated??)??

Meanwhile ukraine recently has changed the regs so over 60 yr old men can, ""join"" the army and has begun training kids 14 and over (touted as something like our cadet program);  if you read history you can see where this is going.  

Anyway, think what you like, I'm no lover of russia(although I have a somewhat soft spot as my enslaved ancestors were able to escape there in 1861 when they outlawed keeping serfs) and won't mention things like all the biolabs close to the russian border in contravention of all treaties, but here's the news, take it as you like or will research;  if you don't like the source, there's numerous others to choose from:

  
President Donald Trump claimed on Friday that an end to [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia)'s war on [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine) would involve ""some swapping of territories,"" a statement that came ahead of [an impending meeting](https://www.the-express.com/news/world-news/179634/nato-russia-cyber-activities-putin?utm_source=mynewsassistant.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=embedded_search_item_desktop) with the Russian president in a yet [undisclosed location](https://www.the-express.com/news/world-news/179662/putin-reveals-potential-venue-trump?utm_source=mynewsassistant.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=embedded_search_item_desktop).

“We’re going to be announcing later, and we’re going to have a meeting with [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia),” Trump told reporters at the White House.

The announcement comes as Trump's efforts to pressure [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) to halt fighting [have been unsuccessful](https://www.the-express.com/news/world-news/179652/volodymyr-zelenskys-defiant-statement-peace-talks?utm_source=mynewsassistant.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=embedded_search_item_desktop), despite his recent decision to move up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) on Friday if they did not proceed toward a settlement.

Though Trump claimed to have knowledge of a diplomatic solution that would involve [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine) ceding some of its territory to [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia), it is a notion which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has consistently rejected.

On May 19, the Ukrainian president ruled out troop withdrawals, saying that Kyiv would not give up its sovereign land, according to T[he Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/trump-reportedly-tells-european-allies-zelensky-that-putin-open-to-land-swap-talks/). In April, he said that he would only engage in discussions about territorial issues after [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) commenced a complete, unconditional ceasefire.

Putin has demanded [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine) withdraw its troops from all four occupied regions as preconditions for a peace deal, and has advocated against its NATO membership. He has also insisted that several major, [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine)\-controlled cities will be handed over to [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia).

Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by ""swapping of territories,"" though he may have been referring to Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014.

“I think my instinct really tells me that we have a shot at it,” Trump said Friday in reference to a peace deal between [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) and [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine). At the time of his comments, [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) occupied about one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.

hey do not have any other choice but to continue fighting.

“It is impossible to negotiate with them. The only option is to defeat them,” Buda, a commander of a drone unit in the Spartan Brigade, told [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-deadline-putin-423e6a28df5186a48b7383eae41c11c2). “I would like them to agree and for all this to stop, but [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) will not agree to that. It does not want to negotiate. So the only option is to defeat them.""

According to an assessment by The Institute for the Study of War, “Putin remains uninterested in ending his war and is attempting to extract bilateral concessions from the United States without meaningfully engaging in a peace process.”

“Putin continues to believe that time is on [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia)’s side and that [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) can outlast [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine) and the West,” it said Thursday.

Trump's comments about his upcoming meeting with Putin came after he met with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House on Friday for a peace summit between the nations. The peace deal was meant to close the book on nearly 40 years of conflict between the two former Soviet republics and reopen transportation routes that the U.S. may utilize amid [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia)'s declining influence in the region.

1ml4zrc,It's over for BC and New Brunswick; first court decision holds that aboriginal title prevails over private title to land,93,AlanYx,68,2025-08-08T19:43:31+00:00,"The Cowichan court decision just dropped: [https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/25/14/2025BCSC1490.htm](https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/25/14/2025BCSC1490.htm)

Until now, it was an open question whether private property owners rights were affected by, and even potentially invalidated by, aboriginal title. Now the BC Courts have held that private property rights (fee simple title) are ""defective and invalid"" and property owners must negotiate a new deal with aboriginal title holders.

Because 100% of BC is subject to aboriginal title claims, this effectively means the end of traditional private property in BC. About 65% of New Brunswick is also subject to aboriginal title claims.

This makes BC essentially uninvestible IMHO. Even something simple like buying land for a warehouse is now risky, as a finding of aboriginal title could mean that the ""new"" owners decide they don't want to allow your operations.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1ml4zrc/its_over_for_bc_and_new_brunswick_first_court/,CanadianConservative,0.88,News,False

Canadians elect a cool. handsome, surfer dude, mostly because he is hot, son of a guy who already did this, and wanted to legalize marijuana. We started relying on the US more then we ever did. Gradually life got worse for Canadians, even though the US helped us in a lot of ways, he blamed it on the waves (Covid) and kept it pushing. Until he started doing authoritarian things and was found to have corruption in his government. But people were fine with him, until his budget went over what he promised. The US now doesn't want to be used to prop up a corrupt government so they want a fair deal, but we dont want to give them that, because we are weak and vulnerable. The surfer dudes popularity surges, and we elect the dude who helped the first dude, who is invested with the people we are supposed to fight and all the things he wants to do, but we ignore it because he is a ""banker"". All of the other people who helped the first dude, and those who got in trouble under the previous guy, all join the ""new"" guy and make a ""new"" government which isnt very different just under a different guy, who helped the first guy. These guys say they are the ones to save us from this ""mess and crisis"", even though they caused it. They take an aggressive stance but dont follow up on anything, and dont do anything they promise, and dont reach a deal by the deadlines they imposed on themselves. they are humiliated by oranger dude south. So their base switch to ""during CUSMA"" where they will get a deal. to hide this fact they do a lot of minimal things to switch news attention and try to make a back room deal with the Mexicans further south, but openly blast saying ""no deal"" because they know we are screwed. so now we are basically waiting for half the people to realize that this new guy and all the guys under him, were the same as the first guy, literally, and still want the same thing. all while we struggle farther and our vital money dudes go out of business.

Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston has announced a province-wide ban on forest-based activities in an attempt to prevent wildfires.

He admitted that ""this situation sucks,"" but maintained that it was necessary to mitigate risk.

""We can take steps while we're in the middle of trying to fight fires, or we can be proactive and try to prevent them,"" Houston said during a press conference on Tuesday. ""We've chosen to be proactive.""

He went on to declare that in accordance with recommendations from the Department of Natural Resources, Nova Scotians would be prohibited from taking part in numerous summer activities.

""Effective 4 p.m. today,"" Houston said, ""we are restricting travel and activities that really aren't necessary for most of us — hiking, camping, fishing, the use of vehicles in the woods are not permitted. Trail systems through woods are off limits.""

He added that camping in ""official campgrounds"" is still permitted.

Those who violate any of the bans will face the same penalty as those caught burning: a $25,000 fine.

""This situation sucks,"" Houston continued. ""Summer is one of the best times in Nova Scotia, and we all look forward to getting outdoors to enjoy the scenic beauty that surrounds us. I get that, and I'm right there with you — but you can still go to the beach!""

There have been around 100 wildfires in Nova Scotia this season, and according to Minister of Natural Resources Tory Rushton, ""they've all been small and put out quickly.""

""That could change in a heartbeat in these dry conditions,"" he added. ""I ask everyone to co-operate, stay out of the woods and be sensible in applying these rules to help keep our people and our communities safe.""

In addition to personal activities, forestry, mining, and commercial activity on provincial Crown lands have also been restricted. The bans will be in effect until October 15 or ""until conditions allow them to be lifted.""

A hotline has been set up for residents to report any activity that ""looks like a violation.""

1mjev5r,Conservatives slam Liberals for halting immigration data updates,103,84brucew,21,2025-08-06T19:55:38+00:00,"Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner is accusing the federal government of deliberately withholding key immigration data from Canadians, saying the Liberals are hiding the consequences of their “irresponsible, failed” policies.

In a statement released Wednesday, Rempel Garner, the Opposition’s immigration critic, said Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has not published any public immigration datasets since Mark Carney became prime minister in March — breaking with long-standing practice.

“How many illegal border crossings have we had? How many more asylum claims have piled on to an already backlogged waitlist?” she said. “How many more permits have the Liberals handed out that continue to overwhelm our housing, healthcare system and job market?”

Rempel Garner said the public has a right to know the scope of immigration activity and accused the Liberal government of dodging accountability.

She demanded that Carney resume regular data releases so Canadians can assess the immigration system for themselves.

“Conservatives call on Mark Carney and the Liberals to be straightforward with Canadians,” she said.

1mitptw,CPC needs to become more populist,39,Abzz22,34,2025-08-06T03:11:46+00:00,"\*\*this post is from my drafts after I found out r/Canada_sub was not active anymore, these were my thoughts just after the election and still are\*\*

Sorry but the days of CPC being a moderate ""lets all get along"" party should be over, when is the party going to have ACTUAL conservative policies in place?

People in this sub might totally disagree with this post, thats fine BUT you cannot tell me the CPC can continue down the path of ""lets not be too right-wing so we can win some left-wing and centrist votes"" in future elections. For god sake this has been the strategy in 2021 and 2025 and even 2019, and did it give any results?

Let's look at couple ""conservative"" wins in the global scene.

\- Donald Trump 2016, 2024, was his first campaign a ""normie"" and moderate campaign? NO, he literally campaigned on building a wall between US and Mexico which organized the Right-Wing/Libertarian votes and radicalized the independents on what mass immigration could mean for the economy, did he shy away from being pro-life? NO, was he scared of what mean stories the Democrat MSM would right about him? no he didn't give a fuck, perhaps one could argue, the more hit-pieces they wrote about him, the more popular he became.

\- Javier Milei 2023, We all remember those crazy Milei videos with a chainsaw in the campaign, he won the majority of the votes with 55% and his whole campaign was about shutting down ENTIRE government departments, not ""reform"", not ""cutting down"", but rather a more radical approach of CLOSING those departments that were eating up government money. I know I know Milei is more of a libertarian but the point is his campaign was a radical one.

\- Many more examples in EU (AFD, Wilders, Meloni) most of EU slogans were rightly about immigration, not just closing the borders, but starting Remigration of those who already have acquired EU passports, now this is radical.

A right-wing party simply cannot just have ""tax cuts"" or ""immigration restriction"" as their campaign slogan, the average disgruntled voter will just say ""well I can get those stuff from the liberals"".  The CPC needs to get to the bottom of the issue, why is mass immigration bad? because it deeply changes the Anglo-French/European culture and customs that Canada was founded on, why should we build oil & gas infrastructure? because we might be able to have the same wealth as those gulf countries have, which means 0% tax rates for you as a individual, why should gender insanity not be taught in school? because children are innocent kids that should not be brainwashed by woke teachers.

**TL;DR:** 

Pierre is from the libertarian wing of the CPC, if he cannot adapt and start pointing out the REAL  problems out loud then it might be time to change him as a leader and put in place someone that will say what they think without worrying about what the Liberal MSM might write about him (Maybe Jivani? idk) or maybe someone outside of politics can work, idk.

If you disagree with my opinion on what the CPC's strategy has to be for the next election (whenever that will be), please comments and share your thoughts on why that is a better strategy.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1mitptw/cpc_needs_to_become_more_populist/,CanadianConservative,0.76,Discussion,False

1mip309,"Forget the gun ban rhetoric, the numbers tell the truth",41,84brucew,15,2025-08-05T23:36:46+00:00,"The numbers don’t lie. In 2024, more Canadians than ever earned their Possession and Acquisition Licences (PALs,) and that’s good news for public safety, no matter what the politicians say.

“The number of adults in Canada with a government-approved gun licence rose to a new high in 2024,” writes Nicolas Johnson, “again defying the Liberal Party-led administration’s actions to criminalize gun users and confiscate our gear.”

This five-year surge in lawful firearms ownership reflects a growing interest in firearms and Canadian gun culture, and it’s driven by factors ranging from personal safety to sport shooting to hunting.

While the Liberal government sinks billions into policies that punish the innocent, everyday Canadians are quietly doing the opposite.

They’re getting trained.

They’re choosing responsibility over political rhetoric.

They’re joining Canada’s culture of safety because they want to preserve our heritage for future generations.

Let’s be crystal clear.

The government doesn’t hand out Possession and Acquisition Licences like Costco cards.

You must pass thorough background checks, safety training courses, and legal scrutiny.

If you successfully jump through all these hoops, only then can you join the community of Canadians who own firearms, use them responsibly, and obey the law.

This 5 year surge in PAL holders, especially in Alberta and Ontario, isn’t a fluke.

It’s a statement.

“We care about public safety. We believe in personal responsibility. And we’re not buying the lie that only criminals use guns.”

Contrary to media myths, licensed Canadian firearms owners are the most vetted citizens in the country. The increase in PALs reflects a growing tribe of responsible Canadians who value tradition, safety, and personal responsibility.

They’re not the ones fueling gun crime.

That blame lies with gun smugglers, gang violence, and a justice system more concerned with virtue-signaling than victim protection.

In rural communities, a PAL is more than a hobby. 

It’s sometimes a necessity.

Whether it’s for hunting, predator control, or simply being prepared when law enforcement is miles away, firearms ownership meets real, tangible needs.

These aren’t vigilantes. They’re stewards of safety, accountability, and education.

Gun clubs, sports shooting leagues, and the Canadian Shooting Sports Association are building communities rooted in training, responsibility, legal literacy, and mutual respect.

That’s what true public safety looks like. Not billion-dollar bans.

While Ottawa plays politics, Canadians are doing the responsible work. They’re becoming more educated, more trained, and more engaged.

As Calibre Magazine rightly put it, the Liberal gun bans “have all been a colossal failure.”

What hasn’t failed?

Canadians who refuse to be disarmed by virtue signaling ideology.

Canadians who refuse to trade responsibility for false security.

The record high number of PAL holders in 2024 is a positive development for Canada, not a problem.

It reflects a growing community of responsible, law abiding citizens who prioritize safety, education, and compliance; a community who understands that real public safety is built on trust, not fear.

1mimj2l,Of course young white men hate the Left—It hates them,114,84brucew,23,2025-08-05T21:50:57+00:00,"The *Toronto Star* has once again graced us with its wisdom. In a [piece penned by one Craig A. Johnson](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/israel-has-been-accused-of-genocide-this-is-how-canada-should-respond/article_4fe9e268-c921-4c25-b389-6365ff99eb04.html)—presumably not the sort of chap who'd last five minutes in an Alberta oil patch—the *Star* wrings its hands over the left's tragic loss of young men to the dastardly right. ""The left needs to learn how to talk to young men—or it will keep losing them,"" wails the headline, as if these wayward lads are lost puppies rather than thinking adults who've had quite enough of being lectured on their ""privileges"" while scraping by in Trudeau's inflation-ravaged economy.

But let's peel back the layers of this sanctimonious onion, shall we? Johnson's thesis boils down to this: Young men, especially those pesky cisgender, heterosexual, white ones, are fleeing the left because progressives keep insisting they're the root of all evil. They're told their privileges are ""unjust and should be dismantled,"" even as they stare down barren job markets, unaffordable housing, and a dating scene where swiping right feels like a cultural revolution against them. And who can blame them? In the *Star's* worldview, these fellows are supposed to nod along meekly while the left prioritizes everyone else—women, racial minorities, sexual minorities, and let's not forget the ""moneyed classes"" who somehow always end up funding the whole charade.

Of course, the real hilarity here is the left's barely concealed contempt bubbling to the surface. They can't hide their hatred for white people, can they? It's like watching a vegan at a barbecue trying not to sneer at the steaks. Young white men, in particular, are the ultimate villains in the progressive pantomime: oppressors by birth, beneficiaries of some invisible patriarchy that's apparently thriving even as manufacturing jobs vanish and universities churn out degrees in gender studies that lead straight to barista gigs. Johnson admits it outright—the left's message is that these lads are ""members of a privileged class,"" yet many ""feel barely in control of their own lives."" Well, no kidding! When your government is busy importing cheap labor to undercut wages, enforcing DEI quotas that skip over you, and turning every institution into a therapy session for historical grievances, it's hard not to feel like the odd man out.

And here's where the mockery turns delicious: The *Star* isn't really mourning the loss of these young men as equals or potential leaders. Oh no. They want them back, alright, but only as brainwashed foot soldiers—quiet, passive, and perpetually apologetic. Vote for us, they whisper, but don't you dare aspire to lead. Stay in your lane, lads; we'll handle the revolution. It's the same old leftist playbook: Co-opt the masses, but keep the reins firmly in the hands of the enlightened elite. Remember how Trudeau's Liberals love to parade ""diversity"" while ensuring that real power stays with the Laurentian insiders? These young white men are supposed to swallow the pill of self-abnegation, supporting policies that dismantle their own futures, all while cheering from the sidelines as the left crowns new heroes.

Johnson nods to the right-wing ""podcasters and politicians"" who've swooped in like knights errant, selling the idea that conservatism is the true counterculture. He doesn't name names, but we all know the suspects: Jordan Peterson, preaching personal responsibility in a sea of victimhood; Andrew Tate, for better or worse, tapping into raw masculine frustration. These figures aren't perfect—far from it—but they at least acknowledge that young men aren't the enemy. They offer agency, not endless guilt trips. Contrast that with the left's approach: ""Abandon hope, ye who enter here, unless you're willing to flagellate yourself for sins you didn't commit.""

In Alberta, we've seen this farce play out up close. While the *Star* frets from its Toronto ivory tower, our young men are dealing with the fallout of federal green zealotry that's gutted the energy sector. Jobs lost, families strained, all in the name of ""just transition"" that feels more like a just eviction. And when these lads turn to conservative voices—say, Danielle Smith or Pierre Poilievre—who promise to unleash opportunity without the woke asterisks, the left cries foul. How dare they reject our benevolent brainwashing?

But the jig is up. The left's attempt to ""learn how to talk"" to young men is doomed because it stems from disdain, not dialogue. They don't want conversation; they want compliance. Brainwash them into submission, sure—teach them to parrot the party line on equity and inclusion—but heaven forbid they step up as leaders. That role's reserved for the ideologically pure, the ones who've mastered the art of virtue-signaling while cashing government grants.

In the end, Johnson's plea is less a roadmap than a requiem for the left's fading grip. Young white men aren't lost; they've simply woken up. They're rejecting the passive posture the progressives prescribe, choosing instead to build, lead, and thrive. And if that terrifies the *Toronto Star* crowd, well, pass the popcorn. In Alberta, we're just getting started.

1mimczl,Carney dismisses concerns Bill C-18 hindering local news outlets' ability to inform public — says just listen to CBC,12,84brucew,1,2025-08-05T21:44:13+00:00,"Ya, who needs unbiased news?  Just happily march hand in hand to serfdom, poverty and starvation serfs.

Just unbelievable.................

  
Prime Minister Mark Carney dismissed concerns that the Liberals' Online News Act is hindering local outlets' ability to disseminate information to residents when they need it most, such as during wildfires.

He suggested that people simply tune in to *CBC Radio.*

During a press conference on Tuesday, a reporter for *Kelowna Now* told the prime minister that the recent Peachland wildfire reminded local outlets how important it is to be able to share information ""quickly and effectively.""

""Bill C-18 stands in our way to get back onto Facebook and Instagram,"" he lamented. ""Are the Liberals looking for an alternative or rescinding that so we can get that news back on those important platforms?""

Carney replied by stating that ""one of the roles of *CBC/Radio-Canada* is to provide unbiased, immediate local information,"" particularly when it comes to situations such as that which residents of Peachland found themselves in.

""That's one of the reasons why we've made the commitment to invest and reinforce, and actually change the governance of *CBC/Radio-Canada*,"" he added, ""to ensure they are providing those essential services.""

The prime minister went on to claim that his government is a ""big believer"" in local outlets and their ability to share news as quickly as possible, and said that he would ""look for all avenues"" to allow them to do that. He did not, however, make any mention of doing away with Bill C-18.

Bill C-18 was passed in 2023, and has since prevented Canadians from accessing or sharing news on certain social media sites. While Facebook and Instagram are no-go zones for news, X, Threads, and BlueSky still allow such content to be posted.

But has anyone else noticed recently, certain people blaming trumps tariffs as the primary reason for Canadas bad economy? I just saw an article on social media about how Canadas home ownership and marriage rate has plummeted over the past few decades. 

Many of the comments were people blaming trumps tariffs as a primary reason for this, these people are inadvertently showing their lack of political knowledge and their blind political affiliation simultaneously. Again, I’m not excusing trump nor am I denying that tariffs aren’t beneficial both geopolitically and economically. 

I truly wonder how people could be so privileged and blind to the economic conditions of our country, to believe that tariffs from a foreign country that were implemented earlier this year; are the primary reason for Canadas young homeownership and marriage rates declining over the past few decades.

I truly wonder how people think this way, and what leads them to either be so brainwashed by their preferred political party or just brutally ignorant to this kind of thing. Like did we all not just live through the past decade? Have we all not lived through the Trudeau era corruption, nepotism, and incompetence? 

What causes these people to allow their preferred politicians to go so unaccountable, to the point of starting to sink the ship just to spite their political opposition? 

Or if it’s not malice, what causes people to be so blissfully ignorant to believe that their elected officials do no wrong and that foreign elected officials are evil and the culprits of every issue in your country?

1mhl2l7,What independence could be like for Joe and Jill Albertan,13,84brucew,30,2025-08-04T18:12:18+00:00,"*'As taxes consume nearly half of Canadian incomes, Alberta independence offers the promise of thousands in savings per family. It’s not grievance politics — it’s simple math.'*

In recent weeks, I’ve found myself wrestling with an all-too-familiar irritation: taxes. Not the paying of them — which is a civic duty — but the monstrous, ever-expanding burden of them. We Canadians have long accepted that our governments dip deeply into our pockets because, we told ourselves, the returns were worth it. Roads. Healthcare. Security. Civilization itself.

But I ask you now — with each paycheque devoured by line after line of tax deductions, with fuel bills padded by carbon schemes, and with Ottawa hatching new levies in the name of saving us from ourselves — are we truly getting value for our sacrifice?

As it happens, the Fraser Institute’s latest Canadian Consumer Tax Index dropped into my lap around the same time the Alberta Prosperity Project (APP) released its cost-benefit projections for Alberta independence. What began as a curiosity turned quickly into something more serious. The numbers don’t just suggest a better deal — they indict the current one. 

According to Fraser, the average Canadian family — two working adults pulling in $106,430 — now pays a staggering $48,199 a year in taxes. That’s over 45% of their total income. Let that settle. You’re working nearly half the year not for your family, not for your future, but for bureaucracies, bailouts and bloated budgets far beyond your reach. You spend less on housing, food, and clothing combined than you do feeding the federal beast.

What would Alberta independence mean for your wallet?

The Alberta Prosperity Project suggests that we can — and must — reverse this. Their proposal is not just a flag-waving exercise; it is a spreadsheet revolution, and it starts with basic fiscal sovereignty:

* Alberta collects its own income taxes
* Administers its own CPP and EI replacements
* Axes the federal carbon tax and excise levies
* Replaces Kafkaesque property taxes with a flat, $50-per-frontage-foot model
* And cut away the hidden parasites: tariffs, red tape, and federal regulatory bloat

Under even a moderate reform, APP estimates a typical Alberta family could save $23,500 annually. With full implementation? $30,500.

Let’s break that down:

* $14,500 saved just by eliminating federal and provincial income taxes
* $3,200 to $4,500 from replacing CPP and EI with Alberta-run alternatives
* $1,020 saved by cutting federal carbon and fuel taxes (GST remains)
* $1,575 in savings from the flat municipal property tax
* And between $4,000 to $6,000 by shaving off the hidden taxes and regulatory costs that inflate prices on everything from groceries to gas

All told, this represents a net income increase of 22% to 29% for Alberta households. Let’s compare that to the Carney–Trudeau–Freeland Liberal “gift” of a 1% tax break. That’s like handing out umbrellas during a flood and calling it a rescue.

Now here’s the sobering part. Think about this: $48,000 in taxes a year — nearly six months of your working life — goes to government. Compare that to a Russian serf in the 18th century, who was obliged to give half the year to his landlord. Serfdom. That grim institution we were told was the dark past of authoritarian feudalism — have we simply replaced the whip with Revenue Canada?

Can you imagine what an extra $20,000 to $30,000 per year would mean for your family? What it could do for small towns, local businesses, the trades and yes — even young people dreaming of buying their first home?

It's time to ask the real question. The APP makes a serious, sober case — not just to secede out of grievance, but to thrive by design. And as Ottawa sinks further into debt, printing future taxes with abandon, Albertans must ask: is this arrangement serving us, or suffocating us?

We are not beholden. We are not peasants. And we are not fools.

Time to go, Alberta? I say... Time to rise.

1mhl019,The climate report the mainstream media thought you shouldn't see,3,84brucew,25,2025-08-04T18:09:47+00:00,"The U.S. Department of Energy recently commissioned a [“red team” climate report](https://www.energy.gov/topics/climate) by a group of respected experts: Judith Curry, John Christy, Roy Spencer, Steve Koonin, and Canadian economist Ross McKitrick. The report raises serious doubts about the idea of a looming climate catastrophe — yet it’s been largely ignored by mainstream media.

In Canada, only a *CTV* reprint of an *Agence France-Presse (AFP)* article has appeared. *AFP* is a leading partner in [*Covering Climate Now*](https://i79media.com/covering-climate-now-afp-offering-newsrooms-free-access-to-climate-news-feed-training/#:~:text=DEADLINE:%20MARCH%2011%2C%202025%20%E2%80%94,grant%20from%20the%20Rockefeller%20Foundation.), a global network of 500 media outlets committed to pushing “consensus” climate messaging. Unsurprisingly, the article quotes only critics of the DOE report — not the authors. One such critic, Ben Santer, claims the report misrepresents his work.

But this report isn’t a Trump-era creation, as people are encouraged to assume, but the fruit of a workshop led by Steve Koonin, the DOE’s Under Secretary for Science in the Obama administration from 2009-2011.

In January of 2014, the American Physical Society had run a [Climate Change Statement Review](https://asset.cloudinary.com/apsphysics/993aca974d7c16f49f846aab75bba5a1) workshop, led by Koonin, which included scientists Ben Santer, Judith Curry, John Christy, William Collins, Isaac Held and Richard Lindzen — and surfaced deep concerns with the prevailing narrative.

These findings informed Koonin’s book *Unsettled*, and a 2017 piece by Rupert Darwall at the [Competitive Enterprise Institute](https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rupert-Darwall-A-Veneer-of-Certainty-Stoking-Climate-Alarm.pdf) exposed how shaky the so-called consensus truly is. But instead of engaging in debate, critics offered only smears. Climate policy analyst Roger Pielke Jr. noted that rather than argue the science, consensus defenders resorted to name-calling.

Judith Curry [testified before the U.S. Senate in 2014](https://judithcurry.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/curry-senatetestimony-2014-final.pdf), challenging the IPCC’s claims. She pointed out that reducing CO₂ emissions may be futile and that observed warming stagnation over 15+ years shows CO₂ is not the main driver of climate variability.

These kinds of statements threatened a climate industry that had been gaining steam — [backed by wealthy philanthropists](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.524) like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. In response, they launched [*Risky Business*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2020/01/02/how-billionaires-tom-steyer-and-michael-bloomberg-corrupted-climate-science/)[,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2020/01/02/how-billionaires-tom-steyer-and-michael-bloomberg-corrupted-climate-science/) a report that shaped financial sector thinking. But it was based on an extreme emissions scenario known as RCP 8.5 — which is now widely considered implausible.

Even the DOE report says RCP 8.5 should not be treated as “business-as-usual,” stating it's based on “implausible” inputs.

Yet in Canada, RCP 8.5 is still used as the baseline for federal projections, municipal climate funding applications, and documents by taxpayer-funded bodies like the Prairie Climate Centre and the Canadian Climate Institute. It appears in Environment Canada reports and in a 2018 study by [Prof. Katharine Hayhoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjVyvKNlI2Q) for Alberta’s NDP, since [debunked by Friends of Science](https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/Alberta%20Climate%20Future%20rebuttal.pdf).

RCP 8.5 also guides climate risk assessments at the Bank of Canada and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. [Mark Carney’s 2015 speech at Lloyd’s of London](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2015/breaking-the-tragedy-of-the-horizon-climate-change-and-financial-stability) — citing *Risky Business* — helped turn global banks into climate enforcers.

The problem? RCP 8.5 was never meant as a prediction, but researchers [repurposed it to justify extreme climate warnings](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/data-forms/reporting-returns/standardized-climate-scenario-exercise). Pielke and co-author Justin Ritchie have shown how this misuse distorted both public understanding and policy.

Canada now faces massive economic fallout. [Economist Trevor Tombe told Senator Pamela Wallin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIUOrzfC-VM) in a recent interview that the country is in serious fiscal trouble. While some blame trade tensions or populist politics, a decade of expensive, ineffective climate policies is a major factor.

The federal government plans to spend $476 billion between 2020 and 2030 on Net Zero programs — over 400 of them — nearly all of which are built on the RCP 8.5 fiction. This goes far beyond the carbon tax.

We need serious scrutiny. The DOE’s red team shows how real climate science — rigorous, open, and skeptical — should look. We need the same approach here.

As the 2,000 experts of the international [CLINTEL group](https://clintel.org/) put it plainly: “There is no climate emergency.”

It’s time to stop sleepwalking toward economic decline under the banner of Net Zero. Canadians must demand debate — before it’s too late.

Three others, 21-year-old Parminder Singh, 20-year-old Gurkaran Singh and a youth who was 17 when he was arrested and can't be identified, are still before the courts. The charges they face have not been proven.

1mfuw5r,"Saskatchewan tops Canada for mining investment, again",3,84brucew,0,2025-08-02T16:33:40+00:00,"Saskatchewan is again Canada's most attractive place for mining investment, ranking seventh worldwide. 

According to the Fraser Institute's latest *Annual Survey of Mining Companies*.

The independent Canadian think tank's report placed Finland first globally, followed by Nevada, US. 

Saskatchewan secured its spot in the global top ten for overall investment attractiveness for the sixth time in seven years. 

Newfoundland and Labrador followed closely, ranking eighth worldwide.

The survey assessed 82 global regions. 

It looked at two main factors, which were geologic attractiveness for minerals and metals, and government policies affecting exploration and investment. 

These policies included permit wait times and regulatory certainty.

""The Fraser Institute's mining survey is the most comprehensive report on not only mineral potential but also government policies that either encourages or discourages mining investment,"" explained Elmira Aliakbari, director of Fraser Institute’s Centre for Natural Resource Studies. 

Aliakbari co-authored the study, calling it the most comprehensive report of its kind.

Saskatchewan excelled particularly on policy, ranking among the world's top three. 

Newfoundland and Labrador placed sixth globally for policy, while Alberta ranked ninth.

However, the report warns some Canadian regions are missing opportunities. 

The Yukon and Manitoba boast top ten mineral potential globally. 

But, due to weaker policy environments, they rank only fortieth and forty-third respectively on policy factors alone.

British Columbia also continues to struggle on the policy front. 

Investor worries focus mainly on disputed land claims and protected areas. 

Across several Canadian jurisdictions, uncertainty remains a major hurdle. 

Concerns involve protected areas, unsettled indigenous land claims, environmental rules, and regulatory overlap or inconsistency.

""A sound and predictable regulatory regime coupled with competitive fiscal policies help make a jurisdiction attractive in the eyes of mining investors,"" said Aliakbari. 

""Policymakers in every province and territory should understand that mineral deposits alone are not enough to attract investment.""

Other Canadian rankings for overall investment attractiveness include British Columbia (13th), Ontario (15th), Quebec (22nd), Yukon (24th), Manitoba (26th), Alberta (27th), Northwest Territories (45th), Nunavut (51st), New Brunswick (54th), and Nova Scotia (79th).

At this point I really don’t think there’s any argument that our current government is not running the country with the intention of destroying it so they it can accrue political capital to itself by whipping up its electoral base against a foreign enemy. 

There is literally no other explanation for how our diplomatic policy towards the United States has been conducted over the last few months. We’ve destroyed the closest and most mutually beneficial trade relationship in human history, all to protect some dairy farmers in Quebec, to pander to Trump Derangement Syndrome, and to appease some lunatics on the Palestine question. We have alienated our most important ally, one that is completely irreplaceable to our economic well-being.

We only get poorer and more irrelvant from here. Literally everyone but Canada came to the negotiation table as serious actors, except for Canada. 

*We are being governed by traitors to the national interest.*

I’m a young Canadian who believes in negative rights, small government, and freedom — but lately, I’ve been wondering:
Do we still belong in this country’s mainstream conversation?

We founded Canada (Macdonald). Today, 7 out of 10 provinces vote Conservative.
But socially, it can feel like we’re being sidelined, judged, or labelled for simply being pragmatic or traditional.

I’m not anti-progress — I just want balance, respect, and a society where freedom isn’t conditional.

Is Canada still that place for us?

1mdmbga,Withdrew from a $135K job competition due to cost of living,9,k9premiere3,26,2025-07-30T23:44:45+00:00,"A few weeks ago, I made a post about how ChatGPT helped me come up with a sustainable income level to live and retire in the GTA. This post triggered quite some discussion about cost of living in Canada. I decided it's time to let prospective employers know this. I know it's not much but it's my small part...

Here is what I just wrote to the recruiter of a billion dollar company I interviewed with in Monday:

Hi RECRUITER (name removed)

Hope you are well. Just wanted to let you know that I enjoyed my recent meeting with Hiring Manager and his assistant. 

I realize this is kind of off process, because I haven't yet heard back from you regarding a second interview, however I wanted to let you know that I'm no longer interested in pursuing this opportunity. 

The reason comes down to potential income vs the job expectations. In my application, I put down a salary expectation of $175K and during our pre-screen you had asked if I was flexible at $135-140K. 

Upon further analysis of the housing market in the area of the your office (South Mississauga), I would be completely priced out even at $175K. The cheapest townhouse in your area costs $750,000. Per the 20/3 rule, 20% down is $150K, and 3x annual income ($750/3), I would need an income of $250K to afford to live in that area. I cannot make it work at your proposed budget. 

That said, I have no doubts that you had many applicants to choose from so my withdrawal from the competition likely won't cause you any harm. 

I just wanted to let you know that $135-$140K is not sustainable for me and I'd rather stay with my current job/living situation than make the change. 

Thank you

For example, she warns that transgender ideology is resulting in the “erasure” of women:

""Recently, there has been a concerted international push to delink the definition of men and women from their biological sex and erase the legal category of “women.” Such efforts have undermined the practical achievement of equality between men and women. Women are therefore being denied their rightful recognition as a distinct category in law and society. It is a form of “coercive inclusion” that relies on the expectation that women will be kind enough to sacrifice their own recognition and protection for the sake of others.""

That, in so many words, is precisely what those of us critical of transgender ideology have been saying for years. Indeed, she goes on to condemn the purging of female-specific terms from language, pinpointing the terminology I have been writing about in this space for a decade:

""The suppression of women in language and law occurs in several forms: by replacing sex-specific language with neutral language; by reinterpreting sex-specific language to refer to gender identity rather than sex; and by referring to females in dehumanizing, biologically reductive terms such as “birthing persons,” “menstruaters/bleeders” or “vagina havers” with “front holes.” Such a framing is accompanied by describing the distinction between male and female itself as “biological essentialism” and “an intrinsic expression of patriarchal structures,” rather than the material reality onto which oppressive gender norms and stereotypes are imposed.""""",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1md7h8k/un_report_calls_for_ban_on_sex_changes_for/,CanadianConservative,0.95,Article,False

1mcvac6,How to deal with friends who do not want to hear your political views?,18,Apprehensive_Bar_80,31,2025-07-30T02:49:51+00:00,"Hi all,

I’m generally a middle-of-the-road guy politically. I lean slightly right, but I also appreciate and support some left-wing ideas. I have a group of close friends in the U.S. — great people, we ski together, hang out, and genuinely enjoy each other’s company. They’re strong Democrats, very pro-Bernie Sanders, and far more left-leaning than I am.

Usually, I enjoy talking politics with them. Our views can be pretty different, but I like hearing other perspectives and having real conversations. It’s never about winning a debate — I just value the dialogue.

Here’s the problem: my friend’s wife really doesn’t want to hear anything that challenges her opinions. First thought was: ""typical liberal"". She shuts it down immediately if I express a different view. It honestly makes me feel like I’m being censored or silenced — like I’m not allowed to participate in a conversation unless I agree with her. Ironically, these conversations are almost always started by her husband, not me.

Now, I’m totally okay with not discussing politics if it causes friction — it’s not something I need to talk about when we hang out. But it still feels wrong. It feels like they’re allowed to share their views freely, but I’m not.

So I’m curious: have any of you dealt with this kind of dynamic? How do you handle it? Do you just bite your tongue, or do you try to push back (respectfully)? And what are your thoughts when someone wants open discussion — as long as it only goes one way?

1mcdi17,Carney’s Power Grab: Optics Over Action,1,Macaw,1,2025-07-29T14:50:50+00:00,"Prime Minister Mark Carney demanded and received unprecedented executive powers through Bill C5, the One Canadian Economy Act. These powers allow his Cabinet to override standard regulatory processes, sideline Parliament, and unilaterally greenlight ""national interest"" projects. The bill gives a single minister, or effectively Carney himself, the authority to bypass environmental rules, Indigenous consultation protocols, and judicial oversight.

Immediately after the bill passed, Carney crossed the floor and enthusiastically shook hands with senior Conservative MPs. This symbolic gesture confirmed that the legislation was not a principled policy breakthrough but a **bipartisan empowerment of the executive branch**.

And yet, despite this historic consolidation of authority, Carney has done nothing meaningful to tackle the core dysfunctions of the Canadian state.

**Justice system rot**  
Court backlogs, sentencing disparity, and bail chaos continue unabated. There has been no use of emergency powers to inject resources or reform outdated legal frameworks.

**Immigration and refugee policy**  
The system is a Kafkaesque maze of inefficiency, legal contradiction, and bureaucratic paralysis. Processing is dysfunctional, enforcement is erratic, and deportations are effectively nonexistent. Fraud is not merely tolerated,it is structurally incentivized through loopholes, abuse-prone policies, and political neglect. Border integrity has collapsed into performance art. There is no clear purpose beyond flooding the country with bodies, low-cost workers, and appeasing ethnic voting blocs. Canadian living standards suffer, social cohesion unravels, and the rule of law is treated as optional. This is not a system that needs reform, it requires total structural overhaul. Yet Carney offers no vision, no urgency, and no commitment - only well-crafted platitudes designed to simulate action while avoiding any fundamental change to the system.

**Corporate rent-seeking and consolidation**  
The Bay Street oligopoly in housing, telecom, and food continues unchecked. Despite Carney’s insider knowledge, there has been no real effort to restructure competition policy or challenge cartel-like behavior.

Meanwhile, Carney is proposing **massive increases in public debt**, pitching it as a generational investment in infrastructure and competitiveness. But with few binding mechanisms for accountability or measurable return, this debt expansion risks becoming yet another tool for funneling capital to entrenched interests rather than correcting systemic dysfunction. The state grows larger and more indebted, while its core functions remain broken.

Rather than use these sweeping new powers to strike at the structural causes of national malaise, Carney has chosen symbolic performance and elite consensus-building. He crossed the aisle not to lead but to reassure capital and the political class that real disruption is off the table - and that the gravy train, at taxpayers’ expense, will not only continue but run even more smoothly under his watch.

In practice, Carney is not transcending ideological divides. He is combining the worst elements of liberal largesse and center-right populism (Ford type playbook); centralized power, unchecked spending, and shallow theatrics masquerading as leadership.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1mcdi17/carneys_power_grab_optics_over_action/,CanadianConservative,0.54,Discussion,False

1mbhiv3,US hikes softwood lumber duties by 20.56%,18,84brucew,9,2025-07-28T14:22:35+00:00,"United States has imposed steep new anti-dumping duties of 20.56% on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. 

This significant jump from previous rates is creating strong opposition across Canada's forestry sector, particularly in British Columbia.

Announced by the US Commerce Department, the move escalates a decades old trade conflict. 

Canadian forestry leaders immediately denounced the hike as unjustified, punitive, and protectionist. 

The 20.56% anti-dumping duty comes on top of existing duties. 

Combined, the total tax rate on Canadian lumber entering the US will go over 30%. 

This is a major increase from the combined rate of 14.54% earlier this year.

Adding to the pain, the US plans to apply these new duties retroactively. 

This means they target Canadian lumber shipped south since January 1, 2023. 

Industry experts warn this retroactive bill could force some small and medium-sized Canadian sawmills, especially in BC, into severe financial trouble. 

Some may even face shutdowns or risk personal assets.

US officials defend the duties, claiming Canada unfairly subsidizes its industry through low fees charged to harvest trees on public land (stumpage fees). 

They argue this lets Canadian producers undercut American prices.

The fallout will hit both sides of the border. 

US consumers are expected to feel the pinch significantly. 

Analysts estimate the extra duties could add between $15,000 to $20,000 USD (27,400 CDN) to the cost of building or renovating an American home. 

In Canada, the forestry sector, already facing challenges, fears widespread job losses and threats to business survival.

Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Mark Carney and ministers from British Columbia, are demanding softwood lumber be a top priority in ongoing trade talks with the US. 

They argue the US action harms both nations. 

The dispute has intensified under the current US administration.

The retroactive payment requirement is seen as especially damaging for smaller businesses, potentially requiring government aid to stay in business.

1mbhgoe,Christian artist Sean Feucht’s tour bus rammed near Montreal,93,84brucew,62,2025-07-28T14:20:14+00:00,"A vehicle rammed the tour bus carrying American Christian worship artist Sean Feucht and his team outside Montreal early this morning, but causing no serious injuries.

Feucht described the frightening incident in a video posted online. 

""I’m here outside of Montreal, and we were just hit by a crazy car,"" said Feucht. 

""It was out of control. It was swerving everywhere. I don't know if it was intentional … but it rammed into our bus, and we were all sleeping and felt it just ram our bus.""

Feucht reported that everyone on board the bus was okay following the crash. 

The team quickly pulled the bus over and contacted police. 

""Everyone's okay. But man, this is wild,"" said Feucht.

Feucht said the collision was part of a larger spiritual conflict. 

""I don't remember the last time I've experienced warfare like this,"" said Feucht. 

He urgently requested prayers for his team, their safety, and their equipment. 

""Please be praying,"" said Feucht. 

""You know that the enemy hates worship is going up across Canada.""

Feucht also mentioned a potential language barrier as Quebec police arrived on the scene. 

""The police are here, they speak French, we speak English, so that's going to be fun, but we'll figure it out,"" said Feucht and promised to provide more updates later.

They continue their Canadian tour following the unsettling event.

Feucht had Parks Canada cancel his first free concert and then his next five venues also cancelled for ""safety reasons.""

The first six concerts all found new venues in a short period of time.

Sean Feucht's Official Statement on the Let Us Worship Canada Tour:

""Here’s the hard truth: If I had shown up with purple hair and a dress, claiming to be a woman, the government wouldn’t have said a word. But to publicly profess deeply held Christian beliefs is to be labeled an extremist—and to have a free worship event classified as a public safety risk.

The Let Us Worship movement was born as an organic response to authoritarian COVID-19 lockdown policies—policies that, in Canada, were among the most oppressive in the world. The pandemic may be over, but the anti-Christian bias remains.

We will not cower in the face of religious persecution—whether in America, Canada, or anywhere else. We will find places to pray. We will find places to praise. And despite the very real risk of arrest, we will stand with our Canadian brothers and sisters to boldly declare: Let Us Worship!""

1maxmzm,NO LAUGHING MATTER: Bankrupt comedy festival awarded $1.9 million in new federal funding,33,84brucew,9,2025-07-27T21:08:29+00:00,"The federal government is giving nearly $2 million to the Just For Laughs Festival in Montréal, even as the iconic comedy event remains under bankruptcy protection and owes creditors more than $23 million.

*Blacklock's Reporter* says Industry Minister Mélanie Joly made the announcement celebrating the subsidy for her hometown event while sidestepping questions about its financial troubles.

“I invite Montréalers and tourists from home and abroad to take advantage of a rich program that illustrates our diversity and cultural vitality,” said Joly.

Her office did not comment on the decision to fund a bankrupt operation.

The $1,859,000 grant is intended to support marketing and promotion for the festival, according to Joly’s department.

The festival has already received $15.3 million in federal subsidies since 2020, yet organizers told Québec Superior Court earlier this year that they could no longer pay their bills. Creditors are owed $23.7 million, including $1.9 million to the federal Business Development Bank.

Despite the financial turmoil, Joly’s office praised the festival as a major economic driver for Montréal and a symbol of Canada’s cultural identity.

“The Just For Laughs Festival is one of our metropolis’ flagship events,” the department said.

Neither Canadian Heritage nor Joly’s office would explain what safeguards, if any, are in place to protect taxpayer money in the event of a default.

Court filings by Just For Laughs’ lawyers painted a bleak financial picture, citing rising labour costs, high inflation, weakened consumer demand, and a long-term decline in corporate sponsorships.

“Despite the popularity of the Montréal festival and a high attendance rate, festivals require several key sponsors to break even or achieve profitability,” producers wrote in their filing.

“Unfortunately since 2018 the Montréal festival has not been able to secure sponsorship revenues at a level equivalent to the pre-2018 period. The resulting impact has been devastating.”

Last summer, following the festival’s collapse, cabinet awarded $600,000 to the ComediHa! festival, a competing comedy event in Montréal. At the time, the tourism department said the emergency funding aimed to “fill the important niche occupied by the Just For Laughs festival in Montréal’s 2024 summer programming.”

1maxkrt,Saskatchewan adds 77 healthcare positions for rural communities,6,84brucew,5,2025-07-27T21:05:57+00:00,"Note the savings that are paying for this were found by eliminating 26 senior bureaucrat positions.....

Saskatchewan government and Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) are creating 77 new full-time healthcare positions across 30 rural and remote communities to strengthen emergency services and reduce staffing shortages.

The positions will be funded through $6.2 million in savings from recent cuts to administrative leadership at the SHA. 

Health Minister Jeremy Cockrill announced the new roles will include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, medical radiation technologists, and other frontline care providers.

""Adding Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, Medical Radiation Technologists, and other positions that deliver hands-on patient care reflect the shared commitment of the Government of Saskatchewan and SHA to ensure Saskatchewan residents have seamless access to care, as close to home as possible,"" said Cockrill. 

""The SHA has closely scrutinized their costs and identified savings that will help fund these essential positions and provide positive care to patients in communities stretching across the province.""

SHA achieved $10.4 million in total annual savings by eliminating 26 senior leadership positions along with other corporate and management roles in June. 

The remaining $4.2 million has already been directed toward 47 clinical manager positions in 45 rural and northern communities.

SHA Chief Operating Officer Derek Miller said the spending reflects the organization's focus on strengthening local care. 

""This investment reflects our ongoing focus on strengthening care at the local level by placing permanent healthcare professionals in communities where they are needed most,"" said Miller. 

""By stabilizing staffing and reducing service disruptions, we are helping ensure residents receive reliable access to high-quality care.""

The new positions build on previous rural health initiatives that have added 315 positions since 2022 as part of the provincial Health Human Resources Action Plan. 

The 77 additional roles will target communities experiencing ongoing service disruptions or staffing challenges.

Some roles will create entirely new positions, while others will convert part-time vacancies into permanent full-time positions.

Rural and Remote Health Minister Lori Carr said previous stabilization efforts have shown measurable results. 

""This is the latest progressive step forward in our plans to strengthen rural and northern healthcare teams that are making a real difference to the people of Saskatchewan,"" said Carr. 

""Efforts include the Saskatchewan Rural and Remote Recruitment Incentive, adding several hundred new and enhanced positions in over 70 communities, implementing the Virtual Physician program, and expansion of Point-of-Care Lab Testing. Thanks to these initiatives, rural and remote communities saw a 28% reduction in service disruption days. In the past 16-months, Virtual Physician coverage and Point-of-Care Lab Testing helped prevent more than 2,700 service disruptions.""

Many new positions will be eligible for the Saskatchewan Rural and Remote Recruitment Incentive (RRRI), which provides up to $50,000 over three years with a service agreement. 

Since launching the RRRI in 2022, the program has hired more than 400 healthcare professionals in approximately 70 communities.

The positions will be distributed across communities including Estevan, Humboldt, Kindersley, La Ronge, Lloydminster, Moose Jaw, North Battleford, Prince Albert, and Weyburn, among others.

1mamhxk,Trump Says Hamas Leaders to be ‘Hunted Down’ After Terror Group Rejects Hostage Deal,30,84brucew,5,2025-07-27T13:37:34+00:00,"Posting as ""our fed gov't"" (of toronto and ottawa) are siding with hamas like the leftist morons they are.  They have chosen poorly.  link at btm.

After Hamas rejected a U.S.-backed hostage deal, President Donald Trump slammed the terrorist group for having no intention of negotiating a ceasefire agreement, adding that its leaders in Gaza “are going to be hunted down.”

“They pulled out of the negotiations, which was very unfortunate,” President Trump [said](https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/07/25/trump-hamas-doesnt-want-a-deal-well-need-to-get-rid-of-them/). “Hamas never really wanted a deal. I think they want to die, and that’s very bad. We’ve reached a point where the job needs to be finished.”

“They walked away from the talks, and now there will be fighting. We’ll need to clean them out. We’ll need to get rid of them,” he [added](https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/07/25/trump-hamas-doesnt-want-a-deal-well-need-to-get-rid-of-them/).

The president made those remarks at the White House on Friday, a day after the U.S. Middle East peace envoy, Steve Witkoff, recalled the hostage negotiating team from Doha, Qatar. Israel also [called back its negotiators](https://legalinsurrection.com/2025/07/israel-recalls-hostage-negotiating-team-from-qatar-as-hamas-makes-new-demands/) following Hamas’s rejection.





[*The Times of Israel*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/trump-hamas-didnt-want-to-make-a-ceasefire-deal-its-leaders-will-be-hunted-down/) reported Trump’s remarks:

>

# Netanyahu: U.S., Israel working on “alternative options to bring our hostages home.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on Friday, echoed President Trump’s sentiments, saying that the U.S. and Israel were working on “alternative options to bring our hostages home.”

“Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff got it right,” he [said](https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/07/25/trump-hamas-doesnt-want-a-deal-well-need-to-get-rid-of-them/). “Hamas is the obstacle to a hostage release deal. Together with our U.S. allies, we are now considering alternative options to bring our hostages home, end Hamas’s terror rule, and secure lasting peace for Israel and our region,” he added.

The statement suggests that Israel could count on Washington’s backing for its military efforts to free the remaining hostages and eliminate Hamas as a terrorist fighting force in Gaza.



# IDF eliminates Hamas’s domestic spy chief

With Hamas rejecting ceasefire talks, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) kept up the pressure on Hamas, operating in several terrorist strongholds across Gaza.

The Israeli “ground troops are continuing to operate against the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement Friday. “IDF troops are continuing their operational activity in the northern Gaza Strip, operating in the areas of Beit Hanoun, Jabaliya, and Daraj Tuffahm.”

The Israeli Air Force (IAF) was backing the ground operation. “Over the past day, in cooperation with ground forces, the IAF struck dozens of terror targets in the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, military structures, tunnels, anti-tank missile launch posts, weapons storage facilities, and additional terrorist infrastructure sites,” the IDF statement said.

The IDF eliminated the chief of Hamas’s domestic spying operation, delivering another blow to the terrorist group’s existing leadership. “Earlier this week \[Wednesday\], the IDF struck and eliminated in the northern Gaza Strip the terrorist Amjad Muhammad Hassan Shaer, head of the Counterintelligence Directorate in Hamas’ General Security Apparatus,” the military announced Friday.

Hamas’s Counterintelligence Directorate not only suppresses dissidents and opponents inside Gaza, but also helps in plotting and executing terrorist attacks, the IDF explained. “The Counterintelligence Directorate is responsible for suppressing opposition to Hamas’ rule, thwarting espionage against the terrorist organization, and securing senior officials and assets of the terrorist organization within the Gaza Strip and outside of it. The directorate represents a vital part of Hamas’ General Security Apparatus, which is responsible, among other things, for building an intelligence assessment that assists senior Hamas officials in decision-making and executing terror attacks against the State of Israel,” the IDF statement added.

1mahlpn,Journalist shot by rubber bullet during LA riot reveals double standards in Canadian media,17,Devils_Iettuce,1,2025-07-27T08:57:58+00:00,"I feel bad now, I've commented that it's hypocritical to have a woman on here that struggles with english be a news castor for them while at the same time talking about how dei policy is bad. While I stand by that and think ffs rebel news get this woman a speech therapist, she quite literally took a bullet while reporting on the breach of our freedoms of speech and freedoms in general. And if you disagree I've got a story for you.

At this time I was on solitary confinement, what did I do? I was sick and in the hospital and our government demanded people in the hospital only be allowed one visitor and they be selected immediately and could not be changed. So for a year I wasn't allowed to see my brothers, young nieces, friends and family all because we had a crazy crackdown. For nearly a month I went with no food or water, only surviving by the saline solution in my IV because our broken healthcare system combined with our joke of a government. I was awaiting a surgery and you're not allowed to consume anything the day before, so when it got pushed back day after day, I waited, starved. Over three weeks in, my mother my designated visitor, and the only person allowed to see me (this may sound hilarious) I begged to bring me a foot long sub from subway. I knew it wasn't allowed and it may get me in trouble but I was STARVING. I knew if I had surgery the following day I could possibly aspirate during the surgery and it may kill me. (Aspiration occurs when substances, such as food, liquid, or vomit, accidentally enter the windpipe and lungs instead of the esophagus) So when my mother smuggled in the sub I told the nurses I planned to eat. They told me I couldn't, that if I ate it, the surgery would be pushed back and I'd be forced to go another day without food. I cried over that sub at that moment lol, they finally agreed they would call the surgeon, if my surgery was pushed back by midnight then they would let me eat my sub. I got to eat my sub, and days later I got my surgery. And honestly that wasn't even touching the horror story that was that hospital stay but it makes my point.

You may not agree with the trucker convoy, I didn't even know about it at the time. But many of those people went, and pissed off all kinds of people, but they did it because our freedoms were being trampled on. People were losing their livelyhoods, people were dying alone in the hospitals. And people you may disagree with, were blasting our national anthem as they were beaten and jailed for protesting.

This type of shit makes me ashamed to be Canadian, because this is what we stand for today.

1ma7woo,Growing number of patients in BC leaving emergency rooms without receiving care,9,84brucew,1,2025-07-26T23:48:12+00:00,"It has been revealed that a growing number of people in British Columbia are leaving emergency rooms without receiving care.

Between 2018 and 2025, that cohort nearly doubled in size.

According to data from the BC Ministry of Health, in Fiscal Year 2018-19 a total of 76,157 people left the emergency room without receiving care. In FY 2024-25, that number ballooned to 141,961.

There was a spike following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the situation had gotten progressively worse. Between 2023 and 2025 alone, the number of people who went to emergency rooms but left without being cared for rose by 18%.

The numbers varied greatly by health authority. The north fared particularly well, with little change between 2018 and 2025. In the Interior, Vancouver Coastal, and Vancouver Island health authorities, the uptick was more noticeable.

The Fraser Health Authority saw the highest number of people leaving emergency rooms without receiving care, with 64,972 such cases recorded in FY 2024-25. The region, which encompasses much of the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley, saw its population grow rapidly between 2018 and 2025, with that trend expected to continue well into the future.

""When patients first arrive at the ED, they are triaged and seen based on acuity,"" Health Minister Josie Osborne said in a statement to the [*CBC*](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/spike-in-b-c-patients-leaving-emergency-1.7592315). ""The sickest patients are always seen first. Patients are never turned away from the ED.""

She explained that ""the number of patients that leave the ED without being seen is a small proportion of the total number of visits to the ED,"" and that, ""in general, patients with lower acuity levels are more likely to leave the ED without seeing a physician.""

The aforementioned dataset did not show people's reasons for visiting the emergency room.

1m9y3cn,Why Poilievre will win in Battle River-Crowfoot (but western alienation will remain),18,Sergey_Taboritsky,23,2025-07-26T16:47:06+00:00,"It’s a very safe riding. There is no serious left wing opposition and the opposition right is divided between many minor candidates(PPC, United party, Libertarians) meaning even if they do get lots of votes they won’t win. 

Bonnie Critchley, the most famous independent is to Poilievre’s left somewhat, not a local really either, nor is she going to win the separatist vote being a staunch loyalist. She has a very specific niche. The longest ballot committee will just be a general nuisance to everyone, but maybe to Critchley most of all also as an independent. 

I am in the camp that back in April it was Poilievre’s awful advisors that reined him in to become “elbows up” lite rather than the strong contender he was before the election. There is a huge difference between pitching a wide tent to win moderates and becoming discount Carney, he seems to be trying to fix this. 

This narrative of Poilievre’s Alberta homecoming though is just that, a narrative. Yes he was born in Alberta sure, but he hasn’t actually lived here in over two decades. He only chose to return after narrowly losing his riding due to some serious boundary changes. 

He honestly strikes me in some ways as a career politician donning a cowboy hat and suddenly trying to become one of us, because that’s all it takes right?

I am not saying he should endorse separatism or anything, that would be incredibly foolish for a man seeking to become Prime Minister, but I am saying he’s pretty silent on issues like that are pushing more and more Albertans into wanting to leave because they don’t see a fair deal inside confederation. For instance Poilievre seldom talks about equalization and when he did during the election it was in favour of the broken status quo. 

No wonder Albertans are discontent, when all many see is a choice between what we have now or token changes easily reversed. Part of it is on Albertans for blindly voting to the point of being totally taken for granted, but still.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1m9y3cn/why_poilievre_will_win_in_battle_rivercrowfoot/,CanadianConservative,0.73,Opinion,False

1m9wu9m,Britain Is Facing Complete “Societal Collapse”,41,84brucew,13,2025-07-26T15:56:20+00:00,"Posting as this is our future under the liberals:

**Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has warned that unless change is instituted rapidly, Britain will soon succumb to complete societal collapse.**

“We live increasingly in a lawless Britain… most people think that Britain has become lawless”, Farage remarked Monday at a press conference to launch a new law and order policy platform.

“We’re actually facing, in many parts of our country, nothing short of societal collapse,” Farage warned, adding “People are scared to go out to the shops, scared to let their kids out. That is a society that is degraded, and it’s happening very, very rapidly.”

Farage further suggested that Britain should leave the European Court of Human Rights in order to restore effective criminal deterrence.

Farage maintains that the ECHR undermines the country’s ability to deport foreign criminals, terrorists, and illegal migrants, thereby weakening criminal deterrence. 

He contends that exiting the system would remove legal barriers imposed by foreign judges, and allow the UK to swiftly remove dangerous individuals, free up prison space, reduce taxpayer burdens, and send a strong message that crime by non-citizens will result in certain expulsion. 

This, in his view, would restore effective deterrence by ensuring consequences are enforced without interference, discouraging both criminal activity and illegal immigration.

Among a range of policies he outlined to avoid a descent into societal collapse, Farage suggested outsourcing hardened criminals to foreign jails and a hard-line three-strikes and you’re out rule, meaning after three convictions there would be no more rehabilitation for offenders.

He noted that one of the most egregious aspects of the collapse is that the government is obsessed with drilling it into the British people that everything is getting better when citizens can see the rampant degradation all around them.

“Huge numbers of law-abiding, taxpaying Britons have also lost respect for the police but in a different way. The idea, the concept that we’re living in a system of two-tier policing and two-tier justice under two-tier Keir has really taken hold,” Farage urged.

Farage noted that crimes such as shoplifting and drug taking have been allowed to become a part of everyday life in cities, and that one in three Londoners have now been victims of mobile phone theft.

He vowed that his party will work to halve crime in five years if elected to parliament by becoming “the toughest party on law and order and on crime that this country has ever seen”, and instituting “zero tolerance policing.”

Farage also floated the idea of Army run centres for repeat petty criminals to be held in and made to undergo a program of reform.

He pointed to Rudy Giuliani’s tenure as Mayor of New York City as an example of how to restore law and order in a broken down society.

“We are borrowing from the Giuliani playbook, unashamedly, I think what Rudy Giuliani did to New York in the 1990s was nothing short of a blooming miracle,” Farage stated.

He added, “And as someone who spent over 20 years working for American companies, I was a regular transatlantic commuter, and I saw what one inspired, brave leader with a New York Police Department that wanted to work with him… I saw what could happen, what the potential was. I believe London needs a Giuliani, not a Sadiq Khan.”

1m9vg0c,"""Everyone who disagrees with me is a liberal""",45,jimbo40042,66,2025-07-26T14:59:35+00:00,"My last few comments in this sub have been downvoted with comments like ""go back to the Canada sub"". I'm morally and politically conservative and definitely hard right on certain passion issues. I just don't play the ""team sport"" aspect of politics and have no loyalty or respect for Poilievre and think he needs to go. He's an idiot who blew it for not standing up strongly enough for conservative values during the campaign (but NOW he complains about immigration). Frankly I think he just wants to be leader of the opposition forever because complaining is an easy job but actually leading and making decisions is hard.

If I had it my way, Canada would have crime and drug policies similar to Singapore or Indonesia. The ""tough on crime"" and ""war on drugs"" of the 80's didn't work because they didn't go far enough. I would make Richard Nixon look like Richard Simmons:

* Death penalty for murderers and drug traffickers
* Abolish the Young Offenders Act 
* Abolish or significantly change the Charter
* Illegal drug users are committing crimes and belong in institutions against their will until clean. I'm willing to concede that those institutions aren't to be shared with violent thugs as long as they didn't also commit violent crime.  
* Increase transparency and accountability for judges who give soft on crime rulings and who use the judiciary for their own little moral high ground instead of doing their job which is to keep the streets safe from criminals. 
* Open ""gulags"" in the Canadian north for the worst offenders
* Significant rollback of marijuana legalization. And if the potheads don't like it and point to the hypocrisy with alcohol, cool, I'll do that with booze too!
* Privatize the prison system. The quality of life in there is not a concern of mine
* Implement the Castle doctrine. The fewer thugs who make it to a court date, the better it is to keep the system moving. 

I also support tougher immigration policies and ban the LMIA program for anything other than farming. That shouldn't be a conservative policy but it is ever since the NDP abandoned workers for wokeness. I support the property rights of responsible gun owners even though I never shot a gun in my life. I support tax cuts and similar types of incentives in order to get Canada's small business, tech industry and stock market moving and move away from the real estate feudal system.

Despite all this, I've been called a ""liberal"" because:

* I don't support Western separation, or at least take Ontario with you. Any rural region west of Ottawa to the Pacific coast is politically and culturally similar. This is not strictly a west versus east issue. 
* I try to see the best in and remain positive about Carney, if nothing more than for my own mental health. I didn't vote for him, but whining 24/7 about how he's a globalist envirocommie isn't going to help one bit. We are stuck with him for the time being so I am going to make the best of it. At least there are some things that are good about him, unlike Trudeau who was 100% bad. The people on the leftist subs are crying about Carney's ""austerity"" and threatened cuts to the bloated public service. So he must be doing something right. 
* Although I generally lean to the conservative side on ""woke"" and culture war issues, I'm not hyperfixated on this shit. I'm not a parent, but I do remember being a kid. Come on, your kid is going to find all sorts of weird shit online behind your back if they want to, long before they find some weird LGBTQ sexbook buried in some section in their school library. Do good parenting and your kid will be immune to this stuff. If your kid sees some 200 pound dude in a dress wearing makeup and in a wig with big fake breasts and hairy size 13 feet in high heels reading to them and thinks ""yeah, that's what I want to be when I grow up"", that's YOUR problem, not everyone else's problem. 

I grew up in a time when conservatives were considered the rational and reserved ones. Unlike many of my peers at the time, I've been a conservative and voted for the Canadian Alliance back when I first could at age 18. While I appreciate that young people are shifting more conservative, it's come with this distinct uptick in emotional whining and ""everyone who disagrees with me is a liberal or a globalist or xyz thing I don't like"" type of talk. What happened to freedom of speech and debate? Let's leave the echo chambers to the NDP types. 

Conservatives can absolutely win in Ontario and the country (Quebec is a lost cause), but need to show themselves as rational and professional. Despite the liberal propaganda, we live in a naturally conservative country. I don't mean politically, I mean morally. People are for lower taxes. People aren't for crime. People aren't for government handouts. People are for personal freedom and that includes responsible gun owners as much as it does for gays.  I live in the outskirts of Toronto, the so-called Liberal bastion of the anglophone part of the country. And right now we have a dipshit of a mayor in Chow. But it took a snap election with the centre or right vote being split six ways before Chow had enough freeloaders and lifetime unionists to somehow get her in. Compare Toronto's mayoral results from 2010 onwards to pretty much any city in a blue state in the U.S. and it would be a far-right outlier.

1m9s53j,"Lefties, Illegals And Minorities Are Finally Experiencing “Consequence Culture”",22,84brucew,2,2025-07-26T12:30:28+00:00,"A US article, but it's happening all over the world, despite left wing gov't's attempts to enslave us;  destroy our culture and prosperity.  Can't happen soon enough.......

  
Travel back in time to the year 2021 and you might find yourself in the middle of a bizarre debate over the virtues of “cancel culture”. At the time the political left was aggressively trying to secure long term power within the US through a multi-pronged psychological offensive – A war on the minds of the masses designed to force Americans into submission.

A big part of their strategy relied on the fundamentals of Cultural Marxism: The combination of Marxist mob tactics, artificial consensus and the exploitation of minority grievances as a vehicle for controlling speech. This was the rise of the “woke movement” to the halls of government.

The root of their power was not martial. In fact, the political left is weak and largely astroturf with minimal ability to project power in a physical way. If conservatives wanted to destroy them tomorrow the task would be relatively easy. We don’t because many of us still have hope that our problems can be solved through peaceful discourse.

What the leftists did have at their disposal was a massive institutional apparatus of government agencies, corporations, Big Tech and NGOs. The full might of the establishment cabal was on their side, which meant they had the means to enforce “cancel culture” and silence their ideological opponents.

I don’t think there has ever been a psychological war on a population that was more pervasive and tyrannical. Not since Mao’s Cultural Revolution in China has a citizenry been under such a siege by their own government. The fact that we survived this event, defeated the onslaught and actually grew a grassroots anti-woke movement without the use of social media forums is truly mind blowing.

Very few people today realize the level of victory that was achieved. We thwarted perhaps the largest 4^(th) Generation “mind war” ever devised and we did it without any institutional access. We won by simple truth and word of mouth.

Another tool that the leftists and globalists used was the mobilization of illegal migrants, gays and minorities as a shield against criticism or counter-protest. If conservatives and moderates fought back with superior debate or our own protest groups, we were immediately accused of racism, xenophobia and homophobia. Merely presenting an opposing view to the progressive machine was considered an act of evil.

Large contingents within all of these groups were happy to go along with the agenda for numerous reasons. First and foremost, DEI allowed them to easily game the system. They could snatch up grants, subsidies, welfare, and leapfrog over more talented and more intelligent competitors in education and business simply because of their “marginalized status”.

Secondly, the system under progressives was two-tier; leftists activists, illegals and minorities were given preferential protection while breaking the law and causing chaos. Conservatives were labeled terrorists for any act of defiance. We were banned from the largest web platforms. Some of us were targeted by the online mob and lost our jobs. Others were “de-banked” and threatened with ostracism from the economy. Still others were imprisoned.

This imbalance of the law bred a culture of entitlement, especially within the LGBT cult and the black community. Illegal aliens were given carte blanche to enter the country and feed like parasites. Not only that, but they were treated like heroes coming to save the US from “population decline” and “labor shortages”.

They all participated in the game willfully and joyfully. They were ALL part of the problem. But, of course, none of them ever thought the party would end or that they might end up facing consequences for their behavior. They joined in the feeding frenzy without considering the inevitable clap-back.

The primary argument that leftists would often use to defend the application of cancel culture was that there was “no such thing as cancel culture”, only the righteous utilization of “consequence culture”. This was, of course, a misdirection. The word “consequence” suggests that a person deserves punishment for wrongdoing and that the leftists canceling him (or her) have the right to do so.

Cancel culture was never about justice or karma, it was about suppression of anyone who disagreed with the political left. A corrupt group of psychopathic people with no support from the majority is in no position to dole out consequences. They can dole out harassment and intimidation, but not justice.

In recent months, however, I think these people are finally beginning to understand what “consequence culture” really is and clearly they don’t like it.  I touched on this issue when it comes to Hollywood and liberal entertainment media in my article [‘Conservative Creators: Don’t Let The Liberal Entertainment Crisis Go To Waste’](https://alt-market.us/conservative-creators-dont-let-the-liberal-entertainment-crisis-go-to-waste/), but I wanted to expand on the idea of payback for the political left and what it will mean going forward.

For example, I have to admit I can’t help but laugh over the Stephen Colbert controversy and leftists crying about violations of “free speech”. Keep in mind that a multitude of journalists and celebrities were fired, banned from public platforms and silenced for not going along with the establishment narratives on covid, open borders, the 2020 election outcome, January 6^(th), etc.

Leftists celebrated when FOX was pressured to fire their biggest name, Tucker Carlson, over his skepticism of the 2020 election and the “insurrection” claims surrounding J6. Carlson was mostly correct in his positions, but that didn’t matter.  The progressive view?  “It’s a private company, they can fire whoever they want…”

Now they are raging over Stephen Colbert getting the boot and losing his time slot (it’s a sign that most leftist late night hosts are facing the chopping block). Never mind that the guy’s show was bleeding around $40 million per year and his audience in the coveted 18-34 age range was shrinking into oblivion. Never mind that Colbert was acting as a shameless shill for Big Pharma. Liberals demand that his show remain in place. They demand that he never face any consequences for selling out and acting as a propagandist instead of a comedian.

Too bad. He’s toast, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Welcome to REAL consequence culture.

Within the black community there is another form of accountability taking place. The BLM movement basked in their privileged status, rampaging through cities and doing as they pleased under the protective hand of Democratic governments. In the process they destroyed whatever social capital they had left and ended decades of “white guilt” in the span of a few years.

Now, white conservatives and moderates just don’t care anymore. We don’t care about being called racist. We’re not interested in the supposed trespasses of previous generations. We’re NEVER going to pay reparations (you’re never going to see a dime), and we’re not going to tolerate ghetto behavior in shared public spaces any longer.

The term “black fatigue” has gone viral in the past month for a reason: White people are done with passively accepting bad behavior from a certain subset of blacks (many black Americans are also tired of ghetto culture and want it to end). The magical accusation of “racism” holds no power over us anymore.

Interestingly, we’re seeing this change culminating across the board, even in the corporate world. We see cruise lines banning typical ghetto habits on their ships. We see retailers abandoning predominantly black neighborhoods because of unfettered crime. We see DEI being dumped in hiring and blacks (and women) say they are being overtly affected. Well, this is what happens when you spend the last several years acting increasingly more unhinged, entitled and violent.

You were protected by a liberal narrative of historical shame, but that’s dying out. Which means people are going to start expecting you to display manners and self control. Otherwise, there will (finally) be consequences.

Illegal migrants might be the most entitled group of all. I can’t fathom a bunch of Americans entering another country illegally and then demanding access to their jobs market and welfare programs while also carrying around Americans flags in protest and asserting that they have no intention of assimilating. They would be shot in the streets in most places and no one would tolerate them.

The same standards are being enacted in the US after years of open borders. The illegals are outraged…and no one cares. There is some moderate empathy for agricultural workers, but they represent a tiny minority among the tens-of-millions of alien migrants that have invaded the US. And honestly, I really don’t care if they sweep up the farm workers, either.

America needs an immigration reset, at least for the next decade so that we can figure out what the hell happened and repair the damage done to our job markets, housing markets and wages. The media publishes sob stories regularly about illegal immigrants living within the US for 20 years or more that are suddenly facing deportation. Meaning, we’re supposed to care more about illegals that broke the law for 20 years compared to illegals that broke the law for 20 days?

No, consequences must be handed down and no one gets a pass. Not anymore.

I was also greatly amused by the recent interview with a slobbering, raving and classless Hunter Biden. Let’s not forget that Joe Biden was probably mentally vacant for a much of his presidency and ostensibly Jill Biden and Hunter were running things with their advisors behind the scenes. Is it any wonder that America was falling apart? We had a degenerate crackhead and his psychopath mommy at the helm.

The moron STILL acts as if he could officially be president one day. But if it is proven that Joe Biden was mentally incompetent during his term and most of his pardon signatures were forged by aids without his cognitive understanding, then ole’ Hunter is in for some legal consequences of his own. In the meantime, the fact that the family has fallen from grace and Hunter is a national laughing stock is enough.

When I witness the wide-eyed astonishment of these people as they finally face punishment, I think of the legacy of the western world. I think of the generations of good men that worked tirelessly to institute a sense of order, principle and the conventions necessary for our society to succeed. I am reminded, time and time again, how difficult is it to create a thing vs. how easy it is to destroy a thing.  I’m reminded that our forefathers never would have put up with this shit.

In the end, civilization cannot survive and thrive unless consequences are exacted upon people who deserve them. I believe we are entering a new epoch when any person or any group, no matter their purported circumstances, will face automatic retribution for seeking to tear down the west. This is the way things used to be, and deconstructionists had best prepare themselves for the returning swing of the pendulum.

1m9cpcc,Freedom Convoy trucker receives conditional discharge,12,84brucew,2,2025-07-25T22:19:44+00:00,"I'm still waiting for charges pressed against the cops who were beating an obviously compliant protester with a grenade launcher(there's a video of it);  that and those who ran over that elderly lady with a walker with heavy horses;  mind you, I and all the citizens of High River are still waiting for charges against the rcmp that sacked High river at gunpoint......

  
Guy Meister, a Canadian truck driver arrested during the peaceful 2022 Freedom Convoy protest, has received a conditional discharge and six months’ probation, avoiding jail time.

Meister appeared in Ottawa court Friday for a sentencing hearing following his conviction on charges of mischief and obstructing police.

“I’m incredibly grateful to the \[Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms\] and to all the Canadians who support its work. Their support reminded me that I wasn’t alone,” said Meister.

The Crown had been seeking a 60-day conditional sentence to be served under house arrest, followed by 12 months of probation.

Meister's legal counsel, Brian Doody, said he would have preferred no conditions but thinks, ""it's being seen as a pretty good outcome. I'm happy for Guy.

""I like that in sentencing in Canada you can raise arguments that during the trial might not have been enough to otherwise lead to an acquittal or get a charter remedy.""

In a post by Right Blend on X, the presiding judge said right away that, “he’s not sending \[Meister\] to jail.”

The judge went on to state he took notice of the defence’s argument that economic activity was reduced at the time due to mandates, but also that “the impact was serious.”

“This is not just a government city and the capital, it's a place where people live,” the judge said.

He said the Freedom Convoy was indeed a mass mischief but would not dismiss the right to protest. He did, however, note, “rights must consider others' rights.”

Meister will have to perform 20 hours of community service and has been hit with a $100 victim surcharge but, the silver lining is he will not have a criminal record as the conditional discharge means no conviction has been registered.

According to Right Blend, after the sentencing, Meister said he was going to “miss” the judge and that he’s “welcome to visit his home” if he’s ever in Nova Scotia.

Doody said that while they were celebrating a ""sort of victory today,"" it had been built on many failed motions but the Canadian sentencing process allowed Meister's legal team to get points out in the open that might not have made a difference in the trial.

""It gives you a second chance,"" he said.

When asked about the next steps and the possible of an appeal going forward, Doody said appealing Meister's sentencing was a ""double-edged sword"" and ""expensive.""

""We've set the bar for sentencing so low,"" Doody said, stating that at the end of the day, it was up to what, ""Guy wants.""

On Feb. 18, 2022, Meister was sitting in a parked truck near the intersection of Rideau and Sussex in downtown Ottawa with a friend. Both had traveled to the capital to protest the federal government’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers.

According to Meister, he was there to exercise his right to peacefully protest for the freedom of individuals to make medical decisions without government interference.

At approximately 12:15 p.m., heavily armed tactical officers in full riot gear surrounded the truck. The officers, who bore no visible ID numbers on their uniforms, carried AR-15 rifles and hammers.

One of the officers smashed the driver’s side window and arrested Meister’s friend, who was showered in broken glass. Another officer arrested Meister, who had his hands zip-tied behind his back and was taken into custody at gunpoint.

Meister was denied access to legal counsel and held in sub-zero temperatures for over three hours inside an Ontario Provincial Police transport vehicle, without access to a washroom. He was then transferred to a makeshift processing station with eight other detainees, who were taken into the processing trailer one at a time.

Ottawa police forced him to sign an undertaking without being offered legal counsel, before being released into the cold streets of Ottawa. Meister’s question, “Don’t we even get to have a lawyer?” was ignored by police.

He later found his vehicle had been impounded, with the windows left open and snow covering the interior seats, resulting in thousands of dollars’ worth of damage.

Meister, who had no previous criminal record and a long history of community service, was later charged.

His case went to trial on Feb. 24, 2023. Doody, argued that his client was arbitrarily detained and arrested in violation of his right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained — protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

1m8n6cj,The mass immigration is killing this country and dividing it more and more,187,King_Osmanj,54,2025-07-25T02:12:20+00:00,"I’ve been seeing a lot of hate directed at immigrants lately, and to be honest, I understand why some people feel frustrated i agree with most of them too. But I also think a lot of that anger is aimed at the wrong people.
My family immigrated to Canada in 2012. We didn’t just show up and get in like nowadays, we went through years of waiting, strict vetting, and a long, stressful approval process. Once we got here, we made a real effort to assimilate. We learned both French and English, we adapted to the culture, and we respected the values of this country. We didn’t expect handouts we just wanted a fair chance to build a life. But what we’re seeing now is completely different. Immigration today feels more like an open door. We mass-import people without proper background checks, and in some cases, we’re literally importing terrorists or individuals with extreme ideologies. That’s not just dangerous it’s insulting to those of us who followed every rule and made every effort to become part of this society. Canada was super welcoming to us and still is, but the difference is between day and night now. Just recently, my sister was camping, minding her own business, when an old woman came up to her and told her to “go back to her country.” After everything we’ve been through, after over a decade of building a life here, that comment cut deep. It also made me realize and different and divided this country is now. How a different government killed everything and made people resent immigrants rather than the own government. The sad part is, you can't rebel against them. I'm closely watching the freedom convey protesters situation and it breaks my heart. If this doesn't stop, I fear it will get much worse. Mass deportation as well strict immigration rules is a must.

Libs have 168 standing members right now (not 169 since 1 MP is speaker), if the Bloc's legal challenge for Terrebonne is successful there could be a by election there in 1 year time, assuming the lIberal honeymoon is over and Bloc wins that by-election then Libs will have 167 seats (assuming no other by election by then).

This might be unpopular but I would not want to have another election until summer 2026 if I was the cons. The NDP will have a leader by early next year and after 12-18 months everyone would have forgotten about Trump (hopefully), Bloc lost MANY seats in QB this last election which I think they want to take back asap.

I think it's important that everyone see how bad the Liberals have managed the country in the last 10 years, although I don't think Carney is as bad as Trudeau economically, I think the Fall budget and 25/26 deficit + the federal employment cuts (mainly liberal voters) will make it hard for Carney to survive being in power past fall 2026.

I'm a Punjabi, my parents immigrated to Canada in 2000. I was born here and love this country to death of course. Now when I tell others that I support the Conservative party, they're often confused. Here's a conversation that often happens:

""Who do you support in politics?""  
""Oh, the Conservatives""  
""Really???""  
""Yeah, what's the issue?""  
""I wouldn't expect a Punjabi to support them, they don't like you""

wtf??? I understand the issues with immigration, and I support immigration reform and reducing the number of people that come in. I have experienced racism and I've seen it happen to others, it's a terrible thing but to say that only Conservatives are racist, or to say Conservatives hate Punjabis, I feel is incredibly disingenuous. I think what Conservatives hate is too much immigration and not enough diversity in who immigrates here. I wouldn't even consider myself a Conservative, but the Liberals have had almost 10 years and almost everything about the country has gotten worse, I'm not left with any other choice.

I think a lot of people who immigrate here want to live a better life and are doing so in good faith, and unfortunately lots are misled about what Canada is. I don't like people who are totally anti-immigration because we do need immigration as a country, of course there's some bad apples like the Khalistanis who cause violence, who I think are idiots and go against the religion many people from Punjab follow (Sikhism). I remember my parents telling me when they first came to Canada, they had to change a lot about how they acted to fit in a new society. But now with so much immigration from the same group, everyone moves to the same city/area and they don't learn/know anything about Canada and don't care enough to learn.

I think in general if you're an immigrant or your parents are immigrants, you aren't able to support the Conservatives because then you're ""going against your own people"".

1m7o10a,"‘UNDER SIEGE’: Crown insists Convoy was an occupation, as Lich faces seven years, Barber eight",34,84brucew,45,2025-07-23T22:58:27+00:00,"Prosecutors in their opening submissions in the sentencing hearing of Freedom Convoy organizers portrayed the peaceful protest as an occupation that terrorized the heart of Ottawa. 

Tamara Lich and Chris Barber in April were convicted of mischief for their roles as “protest organizers” and “social influencers” for the mass protest against COVID-19 mandates in 2022 in downtown Ottawa. 

The Crown is pursuing a seven-year sentence for Lich, and an eight-year sentence for Barber — plus the confiscation of “Big Red,” the truck he relies on for his livelihood as a truck driver, which has been his occupation for 25 years.

“(The) entire city felt under siege,” the prosecutor told the court. Lich, who appeared in court in person Wednesday morning, spent 49 days in jail after the 2022 protest.

Barber, who video conferenced in for the hearing, spent two days in jail, and was released with a staggering $100,000 bond.

Prosecutors opened the proceedings with their submission and sentencing recommendation. T

hey had Victim Impact Statements (VIS), which were submitted in writing and not presented orally to the court. 

The VIS content included negative impacts on businesses, including the luxury Lord Elgin hotel, where many of the imported police stayed, and people who allegedly still suffer from so-called phantom honking. 

In total, said the Crown, the cost of the protest was $7 million for the city and $55 million for policing, The Democracy Fund (TDF) wrote in an X post from the courtroom.

However, prosecution conceded that cost was not directly caused by the defendants. 

""I wonder what the costs of Canada Day are?"" queried Justice Heather Perkins-McVey, per *Rebel News* commander Ezra Levant from the courtroom. 

Barber’s lawyer Diane Magas argued the Crown’s sentencing recommendation was disproportionate to the crime, and is a “harsh,” “cruel” and “unusual punishment,” according to Right Blend, from the courtroom. 

“(This ruling) will not be an easy one"" remarked Perkins-McVey.

Precedent-setting cases were discussed, including the 2010 G20 protest in Toronto, prosecution of participants in the 2022 Coutts protest and Pat King.

 The judge said this case is unique and precedent cases don’t closely match up to the circumstances of Lich and Barber. 

Magas addressed February 4, 2022, where the “line to mischief” was crossed, and underscored Barber’s good faith intentions to work with police about where to park trucks, and made arrangements to move Big Red out of the downtown core. 

The judge acknowledged that he moved his truck on February 8, and noted Barber was “helpful in moving trucks,” and agreed with Magas’s assertion he was ""very willing to work with police.""

Perkins-McVey agreed with an argument made by Magas the well-documented fact that Barber and Lich continuously sought legal advice during the protest further reduces ""blameworthiness.”

Magas points out that the convoy truckers (esp. Barber and Lich) sought out legal advice along the way, and that shows an intention to follow the law. 

Barber’s defence said the convoy was an “exceptional circumstance of protesters standing up to government anarchy,” to which the judge said she wouldn’t call it “anarchy,” more like “perceived overreach.

""Magas in response to the Crown’s questioning of “why Ottawa?” emphasized the fact the truckers chose Ottawa because that was the source of their grievance — they were protesting federally mandated policies. 

She further reminded the court thousands of people lined the highways across the country, cheering on the convoy and calling Barber a “hero,” thanking him for “giving them hope.” 

Magas argued that Lich should not have spent any time in jail at all, and the fact that she spent so many days in custody should not make Barber more liable for jail time, wrote TDF.

She also emphasized the steep costs to the defendants during this two-years-long trial. 

Perkins-McVey said their pre-sentence custody, costs and character letters can be taken into account in her decision. 

According to Levant, the judge seemed to not know Barber was one of many protesters (and people who donated to the protest) to have their bank account frozen under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s invocation of the Emergencies Act. 

“Who froze that (bank account)?” she said. 

Magas plans to ask for a discharge for Barber, according to TDF.

She argued a criminal record would jeopardize his ability to support his family and earn money to pay bills, as about 60% of his truck driving business includes crossing the border to the US.  

Barber was offered a chance to speak, which he declined.

Magas speaking on behalf of Barber said he “never meant to harm anyone.""

The trial is set to carry on through Thursday, and likely Friday.

Perkins-McVey noted an additional day may be needed to discuss the forfeiture order for Big Red.

Lich’s lawyer, Lawrence Greenspon, will open hearings Thursday. 

The judge is expected to release her decision sometime in August.

1m7h8p1,"Despite federal crackdown, firearms licencing hits all-time high in Canada",31,84brucew,6,2025-07-23T18:34:05+00:00,"A new report from the RCMP reveals that the number of Canadians holding a government-issued firearms licence reached an all-time high in 2024.

In Dec. 2024, there were 2,412,122 Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) holders in Canada, representing a 2.5% increase from 2,352,504 in December 2023.

Every province recorded growth, with Alberta and Ontario leading the way, each seeing a 3.3% rise in licence holders. Alberta added 12,006 new PAL holders, while Ontario saw an increase of 22,356.

According to [*TheGunBlog.ca*](http://TheGunBlog.ca), more Canadian adults now hold a PAL than play hockey. The demographic makeup of licence holders remains largely male — 85% — with 15% being women.

Firearms ownership has been deeply embedded in Canadian culture for years, tied to traditions such as hunting, sport shooting, collecting, and self-defence.

Some advocates argue that this cultural significance, combined with government restrictions, may be fuelling a growing interest in gun ownership.

“More and more people are discovering how enjoyable shooting is as a pastime,” Tony Bernardo, the Executive Director of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association, told the *Western Standard*.

“You’ve got an increasing movement of young people hunting because they’re trying to provide food for their families that isn’t full of preservatives and hormones.”

Despite a recent Statistics Canada report saying police-reported crime dropped for the first time in 2024 since the COVID-19 pandemic, Bernardo believes that violent crime still plays a major role in the PAL increase

“People have realized that the government is not capable of adequately defending you. There’s an old saying, ‘when seconds count, police are minutes away,’” he said.

The PAL is the sole licence issued to new adult firearms applicants in Canada.

In total, 142,332 adults obtained their first PAL in 2024 — resulting in a net increase of 59,618 licences, significantly above the 10-year average annual gain of about 40,000.

Licensing figures show:

• 1,598,112 PALs with non-restricted privileges  
• 775,266 with restricted privileges (up 3.1% from 752,002)  
• 38,739 with prohibited privileges  
• 13,505 minor’s licences  
• 4,033 licensed firearms businesses (excluding museums and carriers)

These numbers stand in contrast to the federal Liberal government’s continued efforts to restrict legal gun ownership.

A key element of that agenda is the National Firearms Buy-Back Program, introduced in the wake of the 2020 mass shooting in Nova Scotia.

That program has faced strong criticism from many sectors. In a recent opinion column for *The Globe and Mail*, Robyn Urback described it as a “boondoggle,” pointing out that five years after the program was announced, no firearms had been collected from individual licence holders.

She went on to say, as of April 30, 2024, “only 12,195 firearms had been turned in by businesses. The program had already cost $67.2 million by 2024 and is projected to reach $459.8 million by 2025–2026, with earlier estimates from the Parliamentary Budget Office putting the total cost at over $750 million, plus administrative expenses.”

Critics also question the effectiveness of the program, noting that most violent gun crimes in Canada are committed with illegal firearms.

Statistics Canada reports that in 91% of solved homicides in 2023, the shooter did not have a valid firearms licence.

Also, the Toronto Police Service has long reported that the majority of seized firearms are smuggled into Canada from the United States.

Despite — or perhaps because of — the federal government's crackdown, interest in legal firearm ownership appears to be growing, with Bernardo saying the police and the federal government are working together using the Firearms Reference Table (FRT) to ban more firearms individually and arbitrarily.

“The courts have ruled \[the FRT\] has no weight in law,” Bernardo said. “Yet, the RCMP and the Liberal government are using it like it’s some kind of legal decree. They’re prosecuting with it. They can arbitrarily take any firearm and instantly turn it into a prohibited gun.

“It’s the most heinous abuse of law I can ever remember seeing.”

With the number of PAL holders steadily climbing, and new bans and confiscations planned by the government for 2025 — such as the Assault-Style Firearms Compensation Program — observers suggest Canada could see even higher numbers of PAL holders in the near future.

1m7a3s0,CBC hands out record-high pay raises after cancelling bonuses,55,84brucew,19,2025-07-23T14:02:57+00:00,"After cancelling its taxpayer-funded bonuses, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation handed out record high pay raises of [$37.7 million](https://www.taxpayer.com/media/cbc-pay-raise-atip-ctf.pdf) in 2024-25, according to access-to-information records obtained by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.

“The CBC isn’t saving people money if it’s replacing taxpayer-funded bonuses with higher taxpayer-funded pay raises,” said Franco Terrazzano, CTF Federal Director. “CBC misunderstood the assignment and learned nothing from the outrage it received across the political spectrum.

“Taxpayers don’t care what the extra pay is called, taxpayers want the CBC to stop wasting so much money.”

Earlier this year, the CBC admitted it was going to increase salaries instead of handing out bonuses.

“The Board of Directors, with the advice and concurrence of the President and CEO, has decided to discontinue individual performance pay,” the CBC [announced](https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/independent-compensation-review-results) on May 14, 2025. “In order to keep overall compensation at the current median level, salaries of those affected will be adjusted to reflect the elimination of individual performance pay.”

The CBC did not hand out bonuses in 2024-25, according to [records](https://www.taxpayer.com/media/cbc-bonus-2024-atip-ctf.pdf) obtained by the CTF.

Instead, the CBC handed out record-high pay raises.

The CBC handed out $37.7 million in pay raises to 6,295 employees in 2024-25 for an average raise of about $6,000 each. No employees received a pay cut, according to the [records](https://www.taxpayer.com/media/cbc-pay-raise-atip-ctf.pdf).

At $37.7 million, this recent round of pay raises cost significantly more than raises in previous years. For context, the CBC handed out [$11.5 million](https://www.taxpayer.com/media/CBC-Raises-2023-CTF-ATIP.pdf) in raises in 2023-24.

The higher pay raises more than offset the elimination of the bonuses, which the CBC cancelled following massive public backlash across the political spectrum.

Last year, the CTF released Leger [polling](https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/poll-shows-7-in-10-canadians-oppose-cbc-bonuses) showing seven-in-10 Canadians opposed CBC bonuses.

Even Friends of Canadian Media, an advocacy organization that [believes](https://friends.ca/our-priorities/public-broadcasting/) “Canadians deserve a strong and vital CBC,” spoke out against the bonuses.

“I’m sure you’ve heard about CBC/Radio-Canada’s decision to award $18 million in bonuses, just months after the announcement of significant job cuts,” said Marla Boltman, Executive Director of Friends of Canadian Media, in a newsletter. “This decision is deeply out of touch and unbefitting of our national public broadcaster.”

The CTF reached out to the CBC for an explanation about the record-high pay raises in 2024-25. The CBC failed to provide an explanation.

“The CBC is using sleight of hand,” Terrazzano said. “It’s not saving taxpayers money by jacking up salaries, it’s just giving employees built-in bonuses instead.

“The CBC didn’t listen to Canadians, it isn’t saving taxpayers’ money and it’s clear the CBC is just trying to avoid bad press.”

The CBC will cost taxpayers more than $1.4 billion this year, according to the [Main Estimates](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/planned-government-spending/government-expenditure-plan-main-estimates/2025-26-estimates.html).

The number of employees collecting six-figure salaries has also ballooned at the state broadcaster, according to separate access-to-information [records](https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/cbc-six-figure-salaries-soar) obtained by the CTF.

In 2024-25, [1,831](https://www.taxpayer.com/media/cbc-sunshine-list-ctf-atip-2024-25.pdf) CBC employees took a six-figure salary. Those salaries cost taxpayers about $240 million, for an average salary of $131,060 for those employees.

In 2015-16, [438](https://www.taxpayer.com/media/CBC-Sunshine-List-ATIP.pdf) CBC employees took home six-figure salaries, for a total cost to taxpayers of about $59.6 million. 

The number of CBC staffers with a six-figure salary increased 17 per cent over the last year and 318 per cent since 2015.

“If Prime Minister Mark Carney is serious about saving money, then he needs to step in and put an end to the CBC gravy train,” Terrazzano said. “Or better yet, Carney should defund the CBC.”

1m790yx,Western Canada's canary in the cage,49,84brucew,66,2025-07-23T13:17:38+00:00,"The plight of Tamara Lich is seen by most Western Canadians as a symbol of much that is wrong with this country. Lich might also be an omen for what Albertans should expect from Ottawa in the upcoming sovereignty referendum.

Lich went to Ottawa to protest what she, and most Western Canadians, saw as the egregious overuse of government power during the COVID years. She was treated brutally by Ottawa, and is now threatened with a seven-year penitentiary term. All this for taking part in a protest that would not have been necessary if Ottawa had acted with even a modicum of common sense in their response to the COVID virus.

And, by the way, for “Ottawa” read the Liberals.

Lich (and trucker Chris Barber) spoke out in defence of basic freedoms. Now, after bank account seizures, incarceration, and the torture of being forced through the longest mischief trial in Canadian history, Lich is being threatened with a penitentiary term.

Incredibly, the Crown is asking that the law-abiding grandmother spend [seven year](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/michael-higgins-locking-tamara-lich-up-for-7-years-would-be-shameful-retribution)s in a penitentiary. As *National Post’s* Michael Higgins rightly argues — this would be shameful.

And Pierre Poilievre [agrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dz8qiuKlT8).

To put that demand for a seven-year penitentiary term in context, some people convicted of crimes involving extreme violence don’t get sentences nearly that long.[ ](https://criminalnotebook.ca/index.php/Aggravated_Assault_(Sentencing_Cases)) 

An example is this man, who received a [short jail sentence](https://www.ctvnews.ca/windsor/article/court-hears-sentencing-submissions-for-man-found-guilty-of-aggravated-assault/) for stabbing his girlfriend three times, and then hitting her friend over the head with a pipe. Surely disrupting traffic and honking horns in Ottawa for a while, while engaged in a lawful protest isn’t as serious as stabbing them, and whacking them over the head with a metal pipe?

But more to the point, people who participated in other protests, such as the Wet’suwet'in, and BLM protests, caused serious property damage, and committed acts of extreme vandalism, and dangerous behaviour, like burning railroad tracks that had trains running on them, and toppling ten ton statues, weren’t even charged. And the mobs who have participated in recent Hamas protests — not only seriously disrupting traffic, and causing major property damage, but openly threatening Canada’s Jews, and even calling for another “final solution” — [either](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3llaSgEDmo) escaped prosecution entirely, or walked away with minimal sentences.

So, exactly what crime did Lich commit?

During the lockdown years Lich and other Canadians watched, while increasingly harsh — and frankly, ridiculous — measures were hastily and arbitrarily put in place by a clearly incompetent Ottawa. Provincial premiers were told that they would not get federal money unless they cooperated with Ottawa’s nonsensical plans. Playgrounds were closed, people were told to avoid going out into the fresh air, and such.

The final straw came when truckers were advised very late in the pandemic that they had to be vaccinated. The truckers knew that there was no difference between a virus on the American side of the border, and a virus on the Canadian side. They knew — as did Ottawa — that the vaccine did not stop transmission of the virus. In short, the [truckers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/canada-truckers-protesting-vaccine-mandate-b2017595.html) knew that the Trudeau government’s vaccine mandate for them had nothing to do with science, and everything to do with politics. So, they started their trucks, and headed east, and demanded a meeting with the prime minister.

But they didn’t get one, just as Canadians will never get an [apology](https://www.westernstandard.news/opinion/anonymous-the-unvaccinated-deserve-an-apology-but-is-anyone-ready-to-offer-it/66252) for the government’s unnecessary, draconian lockdown. Instead, these Canadians, and every citizen who supported their legitimate objectives, were publicly insulted and humiliated by the man elected to lead all Canadians — called “racists and misogynists” — while the PM scuttled back into his cottage, claiming to have yet another case of COVID.

This set the tone for the way the rest of the Ottawa establishment treated the truckers. The mainstream media treated them like criminals. The Ottawa police acted like goons. Even the chief justice of Canada saw fit to jump into the fray and [condemn them](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/bruce-pardy-supreme-court-undermined-by-chief-justice-condemning-freedom-convoy).

So, instead of meeting with the protesters and listening to their grievances, Trudeau and his cronies demonized and persecuted them.

You know the rest of the story. Lich was locked up, the Emergencies Act (the renamed War Measures Act) was proclaimed, protestors had their bank accounts attached, and there was even a move to auction off and crush Chris Barber’s semi truck.

 And by the way, what was the purpose of that scientifically pointless vaccine mandate in the first place? After the election we found out. The point was to artificially divide Canadians — to stoke hatred of “anti-vaxxers” in order to win an election by dividing Canadians into two camps.

The secret was revealed by Quebec Liberal MP Joel Lightbound after the election. [He found it](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-mp-politicization-pandemic-1.6343730) repugnant that Liberals would do such a thing. Trudeau didn’t agree. Lightbound was demoted as head of the Quebec caucus, and we haven’t heard from him since.

(How Trudeau stoked division to win an election is discussed in this *Globe and Mail* [article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-infection-point-how-vaccine-mandates-killed-the-justin-trudeau-brand/)).

And the Liberals (Ottawa) used the same trick in the recent election. Using fear to stoke division. But this time they used Trump as the bogeyman, instead of the virus. Their game was to accuse anyone who advocated a common sense, conservative idea as “being like Trump”.

And — again — the strategy [worked](https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/bell-mark-carney-big-lie-fear-name-game).

But, I digress. Back to the convoy. The Lich-led truckers protest could not be allowed for similar reasons. It was an existential threat to central Canada’s (read Liberals’) hold on power.

There is an old Chinese saying that applies here. When a rebellion threatened, the emperor would send his guards out to randomly shoot some people. The [expressio](https://www.jsternco.com/you-have-to-kill-the-chicken-to-scare-the-monkey/)n was that he would “kill a few chickens to scare the monkeys”.

That’s exactly what the Trudeau Liberals did to Lich. The way Lich is  being treated — brutally and without mercy — is meant to be a warning to any other “chickens” who might be tempted to protest against an overreaching government intent on [stripping them](https://fcpp.org/2020/05/01/covid-19-and-the-giant-petri-dish/) of their basic freedoms.

So, Lich will be sentenced by the same judge who forced her to go through the longest mischief trial in Canadian history. This is a charge that should never have been laid — and once laid should quickly been dismissed — or resolved with an acquittal. The judge will “show leniency” by not sending Lich to the penitentiary. This trial is, and has always been, a farce, and a travesty of justice.

Tamara Lich will enter Western Canadian history books as a heroine — in Eastern Canada as a troublemaker. This is not the sign of a healthy country.

This is also not a good omen for Western Canadians. In the upcoming Alberta referendum, it is clear how Ottawa is prepared to treat dissenters, like Lich.

Let’s not fool ourselves. If Ottawa is quite willing to treat “anti-vaxxer troublemakers” like Lich the way they did, just imagine how those who support Western independence will be treated. Expect all of Ottawa’s money and might to be used to crush dissent. They are perfectly prepared to divide families and communities to stay in power.

It will be ugly.

On July 2, 2025, Premier Danielle Smith announced the creation of the Alberta Police Force, and [Sat Parhar](https://www.westernstandard.news/news/new-cops-on-the-beat-alberta-gets-new-police-force-another-option-to-rcmp/65845) as its inaugural Chief of Police.

Predictably, a [chorus of left-wing pundits](https://x.com/KathleenGanley/status/1937902193505718339) and politicians rushed to condemn the move as a populist stunt — a cynical attempt to fearmonger and further isolate Alberta from the Canadian federation.

But the facts on the ground tell a different story.

Over the past decade, the case for an Alberta police force has become not only persuasive, but urgent. Under the Liberal government in Ottawa, national security and public safety have deteriorated across Canada — and Alberta has felt the impact acutely.

Crime rates have [surged since 2015](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/230727/dq230727b-eng.htm), when Justin Trudeau first formed government. Violent crime is up [39 per cent](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/violent-crime-rose-again-in-2022-murder-rate-highest-in-30-years-statcan), homicide rates have reached a 30-year high, and Canada’s Violent Crime Severity Index (VCSI) is now at its highest point since [2007](https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/report-card-criminal-justice-system/jsrc2023/#:~:text=Canada's%20Violent%20Crime%20Severity%20Index,its%20highest%20level%20since%201995.).

In fact, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, in its 2024 [*Report on the Criminal Justice System*](https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20240111_Justice-report-card-SnowAudas_PAPER-v5.pdf), concluded that under Liberal oversight, Canada’s justice system appears to have “given up on its core responsibilities.”

Alberta has suffered disproportionately. In 2015, Alberta’s VCSI stood at 98.9. By 2023, [it had climbed to 114](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWU1ZDBmYjEtMmI2OS00MmNhLWFmYTUtOWY2NzdhNDEyMjZjIiwidCI6IjJiYjUxYzA2LWFmOWItNDJjNS04YmY1LTNjM2I3YjEwODUwYiJ9) — now nearly [15 points higher than the national average](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWU1ZDBmYjEtMmI2OS00MmNhLWFmYTUtOWY2NzdhNDEyMjZjIiwidCI6IjJiYjUxYzA2LWFmOWItNDJjNS04YmY1LTNjM2I3YjEwODUwYiJ9).

Meanwhile, Ottawa’s failure to secure the nation’s borders has allowed a steady influx of illegal migrants, extremists, and narcotics — especially fentanyl — to flow freely across [Alberta’s border with the United States](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/q-a-why-alberta-premier-danielle-smith-agrees-with-trump-about-border-issues-in-trade-spat-1.7412988).

Even the RCMP itself has admitted that it lacks the resources to fully meet its federal mandate, [let alone police the provinces effectively](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2068029/rcmps-ability-to-defend-national-security-is-eroding-report-warns). Its contract to provide policing in Alberta expires in [2032](https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/police-transition), and both [federal](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-federal-policing-structure-duheme-distinct-1.7241797) and [Alberta](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/alberta-sheriffs-police-service-danielle-smith) authorities have signalled that this arrangement may not be renewed in its current form.

That decision cannot come soon enough.

Albertans deserve a police force that reflects Alberta’s values — including personal liberty, individual responsibility, and religious freedom — principles that have come under increasing pressure from the progressive priorities of the federal government.

The RCMP, as currently structured and directed, is no longer equipped to represent or protect the distinct needs of Alberta’s communities. Whether or not critics approve, a provincial police force has long been the logical next step in Alberta’s assertion of jurisdictional responsibility.

Left-wing commentators can continue to accuse Premier Smith of populism. But what they call “populism” is better understood as democratic responsiveness — especially when Ottawa appears increasingly unresponsive to Albertans’ concerns about safety, justice, and basic governance.

Since 2015, the federal government has displayed little concern for maintaining any real quality of life for Canadians, and [even less for protecting Albertans ](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/commentary/historic-decline-canadian-living-standards-continues-2024)from criminal activity.

If Alberta continues to outsource its security to the federal government — and to the ideology that now dominates Ottawa — it will be Albertans who suffer the consequences: rising crime, overwhelmed courts, insecure borders, and a federal police force ill-suited to serve this province.

The creation of the Alberta Police Force is not a break from Canada — it is a defence of Alberta, within a federation where each province has both the right and the duty to protect its people.

1m6ow4f,"Conservatives slam Liberal clean fuel standard, warn of higher food costs for Canadians",27,84brucew,6,2025-07-22T20:16:39+00:00,"Federal Conservatives are warning that the Liberal government’s Clean Fuel Standard will drive up farming costs and grocery bills, accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration of ignoring the real-world impact of the policy on food production and affordability.

In a statement released Monday, Conservative agriculture critic John Barlow said the fuel regulations will impose a hidden tax that will raise the cost of gasoline by 13 cents per litre and diesel by 16 cents per litre by 2030, according to a recent federal agriculture department briefing.

Barlow said the Liberal government is “again burdening farmers and producers with expensive fuel taxes while pretending Canadians won’t notice the rising costs at the grocery store.”

The internal government briefing reportedly downplays the effect on consumers, suggesting that increases in fuel costs “may not be noticeable by most consumers.” But Barlow dismissed that claim as out of touch with the reality facing rural communities.

“Statistics Canada reports that realized net farm income fell by 26 percent in 2024, the largest single-year decline in over a decade,” he said. “Meanwhile, rising costs for fuel, fertilizer, and feed continue to make farming less economically viable and drive food prices higher.”

The Clean Fuel Standard, part of the Liberals’ broader climate plan, aims to reduce carbon emissions by requiring fuel producers and importers to gradually lower the carbon intensity of their products. Critics, including the Conservatives, argue the policy is effectively a second carbon tax that disproportionately affects farmers and rural Canadians.

Barlow said increased transportation and production costs will ripple through the entire food supply chain, ultimately hitting consumers at the checkout counter.

“This is not simply an agricultural issue; it is another Liberal policy fuelling the national affordability crisis,” Barlow said. “Families already struggling with soaring grocery bills and increased food bank reliance will face even greater hardship.”

He added that the Conservatives will push for “common sense policies that support farmers, lower food prices and restore affordability for all Canadians.”

The Liberal government has yet to respond directly to Barlow’s comments, but it has previously defended the Clean Fuel Standard as a necessary measure to fight climate change while incentivizing investment in cleaner energy solutions.

1m6otvk,"Over 3 million temporary residents now in Canada, including 129,000 with expired permits",84,84brucew,26,2025-07-22T20:14:21+00:00,"Canada’s population of temporary residents has surpassed 3 million, making up 18.5% of the country’s private sector workforce, according to a newly released federal briefing.

*Blacklock's Reporter* says the figures, which include more than 129,000 individuals now living in the country without valid permits, were outlined in a May 1 memo from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

The department noted the non-permanent resident population reached an estimated 3,049,277 as of January 1, 2025. That includes 1,462,893 work permit holders, 643,879 study permit holders, 347,268 individuals with both work and study permits, and 163,726 family members without permits.

Also included were 282,601 asylum claimants with only work permits, 2,372 with only study permits, 16,885 with both, and 129,653 asylum seekers without any valid permit.

“This group plays a role in Canada’s economy and social fabric,” said the department’s *Temporary Resident Reduction* note, “but we have committed to reducing temporary immigration growth to better align the needs of our labour market, housing supply and community capacity.”

The data do not account for landed immigrants, but the total population of temporary residents now matches nearly one-fifth of the country’s private sector workforce, which was 16,471,600 in January, according to Statistics Canada.

The presence of more than 129,000 people whose permits have expired has triggered sharp political criticism, particularly following Immigration Minister Lena Diab’s appeal in June for them to leave voluntarily.

“When people’s visa expires they are expected to leave the country,” Diab told the House of Commons on June 9.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner challenged the minister over the government’s failure to remove those with expired status. “They are not leaving,” she said. “What is the plan to get them to leave?”

Diab responded that the Canada Border Services Agency is responsible for removals, but refused to disclose how many have actually been deported.

“We have rules in this country and we expect people to follow those rules,” she said.

Rempel Garner fired back: “Does she not understand if you don’t remove people who do not have a legal right to be here, that the system is meaningless?”

A separate 2024 department briefing, *Undocumented Migrants*, estimated the number of foreigners living in Canada illegally — including students, visitors, and migrant workers with expired permits — could be as high as 500,000.

“There are no accurate figures,” the memo said.

1m6oroz,"SK, MB Premiers strike deal to expand exports through Port of Churchill",1,84brucew,1,2025-07-22T20:12:02+00:00,"Saskatchewan and Manitoba have joined with the Arctic Gateway Group to create a northern corridor that aims to speed Prairie wheat, potash, and other goods to world markets.

Premier Scott Moe and Premier Wab Kinew signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today that puts the Churchill port and its rail link at the centre of the plan. 

Arctic Gateway Group (AGG) CEO Chris Avery also signed the MOU in Winnipeg. 

The Hudson Bay port sat idle after storm damage until repairs finished in 2022, and officials say it is now ready to grow.

""Saskatchewan remains committed to strengthening trade across Canada by supporting and developing new transportation corridors,"" said Moe. 

""Streamlining access to ports, such as Churchill, will allow our goods better access to new and emerging international markets. Today's MOU between Saskatchewan and Manitoba is another way we are building on that progress and creating new opportunities for our industries.""

Kinew said the agreement could begin new investment in mining, energy, and agriculture. 

""Churchill presents huge opportunities when it comes to mining, agriculture, and energy,"" said Kinew. 

""Through this agreement with AGG and Saskatchewan, we are going to unlock new opportunities for businesses in Manitoba and Saskatchewan to get their goods to market.""

The memorandum calls for both provinces to lobby Ottawa for cash and regulatory help to upgrade the Hudson Bay Railway and modernize port facilities. 

Engineers say improving the track bed, most of which sits on muskeg, would allow heavier trains to run all year instead of only in the warmer summer months.

Analysts note Churchill is roughly 1,600 kilometres closer to tidewater than the Port of Vancouver, a savings that could trim freight costs by approximately 10%. 

""Manitoba and Saskatchewan understand the strategic value of the Port of Churchill and Hudson Bay Railway, especially as Canada looks to diversify trade and become an energy superpower,"" said Avery. 

""This joint commitment from Premiers Kinew and Moe is a clear signal that Canada's Arctic Trade Corridor will play a major role in this country's trade and transportation future. As an established, efficient link to world markets, with economic reconciliation built into everything we do, the Port of Churchill is actively shipping, open for business, and ready to deliver for prairie producers and Canadian exports - while returning the benefits to AGG's Indigenous and northern ownership communities.""

The two premiers did not attach a price tag to the corridor, nor did they set a construction timeline. 

Kinew said they will work those details out after talks with the federal government and private partners.

Moe pointed out that the project fits Canada’s push to sell more food, fuel, fertilizer, and critical minerals to countries other than the US.

1m6i8pz,Danielle Smith says pulling Alberta out of supply management is worth considering,23,84brucew,11,2025-07-22T16:09:35+00:00,"OTTAWA — Canada’s dairy and poultry supply management regime could face a major challenge from within with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith saying she could consider the province exiting the quota system.

Smith said at a town hall in Red Deer, Alta., that she found the idea of the province opting out of supply management intriguing.

“(C)reating our own Alberta version of supply management, maybe as a pathway to a market system and maybe just because it would stick our finger in the eye of Quebec … might be (something) we want to do a little consultation on,” said Smith.

Smith noted that Alberta’s share of the [Canada-wide quotas for dairy](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/sector/animal-industry/canadian-dairy-information-centre/statistics-market-information/farm-statistics/distribution-quota) and [egg production](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2025/2025-05-07/html/sor-dors123-eng.html) allotted under supply management falls below its share of the population.

Her comments came after one of the attendees, Lee Eddy, a resident of Red Deer County, said earlier in the evening that pulling out of the system would be one way for Alberta to grab the attention of Laurentian power brokers. The town hall was being held as part of Smith’s Alberta Next panel, struck to consider tactics for enhancing Alberta’s sovereignty.

“If we really want to make the eastern politicians (have to) change their underwear, we should remove our supply management from the Canadian system,” said Eddy.

Quebec producers hold [roughly 37 per cent](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/sector/animal-industry/canadian-dairy-information-centre/statistics-market-information/farm-statistics/distribution-quota) of Canada’s total milk quota, with [Ontario producers holding 32 per cent](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/sector/animal-industry/canadian-dairy-information-centre/statistics-market-information/farm-statistics/distribution-quota), according to Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada. Producers in the two provinces have exerted considerable clout over politicians, given their concentration in certain ridings.

Alberta producers hold just short of nine per cent, despite the province representing more than 11 per cent of the national population.

Eddy suggested that Alberta move first to a transitional provincial quota system and eventually to a market-based system.

Supply management has emerged as [a major trade irritant](https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/newsletters/2025/july/14/trump-2-0-navigating-change-in-canada/canadian-dairy-sector-at-the-heart-of-trade-tensions) with the U.S., further complicating already delicate cross-border trade negotiations.

U.S. President Donald Trump singled out Canada’s restricted dairy market [in a recent letter](https://x.com/PerrinBeatty/status/1943472893289001189) to Prime Minister Mark Carney, threatening to slap 35 per cent tariffs on all Canadian products on August 1.

During the recent federal election, [Carney promised to keep supply management “off the table”](https://x.com/MarkJCarney/status/1907521812017164463) in new trade negotiations with the U.S.  Federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has also said [he supports supply management](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/alberta-separatists-slam-poilievre-for-declaring-himself-a-canadian-patriot-opposed-to-secession).

Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Foods Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, says that Alberta’s relative lack of skin in the dairy-quota game gives it a freer hand to take on supply management.

“I could potentially see Alberta become the quote-unquote ‘sh-t disturber’ that could actually get everyone, and politicians in particular, to think differently about supply management, instead of just (being) blindly supportive without knowing why,” said Charlebois.

He noted that dairy farmers in Alberta benefit relatively little from the existing scheme, paying up [to twice as much](https://globalnews.ca/news/9134934/milk-prices-canada-quebec-farming/) as farmers in Quebec and Ontario for the same share of quota.

Charlebois said it was “absolutely possible” for Alberta to leave the federal system and set up its own dairy commission. But he said that provincial administration would come with its own challenges, such as selling Alberta dairy products elsewhere in Canada.

“Would they consider other provinces to be foreign markets? It’s hard to say,” said Charlebois.

Charlebois added that other provinces could also object to Alberta “dumping” less expensive, non-supply-managed products across provincial lines.

Alberta’s milk marketing board couldn’t be reached for comment.

Lawrence Herman, a lawyer and international trade expert based in Toronto, says that just because Alberta can unilaterally exit supply management doesn’t mean it should.

“There isn’t anything that legally requires a province to participate,” said Herman. “However, the province couldn’t change the import limits and (tariff-rate quota) system, so it’s difficult to see how it would work.”

“The better option is for the feds and the provinces to work together in phasing out the entire national (supply management) system,” he added.

Supply management in Alberta sparked a minor controversy in April, when an [egg farmer in the province](https://www.producer.com/news/fight-against-supply-management-leads-to-jail/) was jailed in a quota dispute with the egg marketing board.

[Smith said in February](https://www.ctvnews.ca/edmonton/article/a-point-of-concern-alberta-egg-farmers-want-firmer-stance-from-smith-on-supply-management-amid-tariff-talks/) that she’d asked her agricultural minister to “start (a) conversation” about potential Canada-U.S. trade concessions relating to supply management.

The Red Deer town hall was the first of [ten scheduled in-person events](https://www.albertanextpanel.ca/#in-person) hosted by the Smith-chaired Alberta Next panel.

1m6en2f,"Ford, Moe, Smith unite to advance pipeline projects, trade corridors",6,84brucew,5,2025-07-22T13:51:00+00:00,"Saskatchewan has joined Alberta and Ontario in signing a memorandum of understanding aimed at building oil and gas pipelines and expanding trade corridors to global markets.

Premier Scott Moe signed the agreement with Premier Danielle Smith and Premier Doug Ford in Huntsville, ON, today. 

The deal builds on a Memo of Understanding (MOU) that Smith and Ford signed at the Calgary Stampede earlier this month.

The three provinces will work together to advance pipelines and pathways that boost exports of energy, potash, critical minerals, and agricultural products. 

Saskatchewan produces oil, gas, potash, uranium, and agricultural products, while also expanding its copper, helium, lithium, and rare earth element exports.

""There is strength in numbers,"" Smith said during the announcement. 

Smith described the agreement as an unprecedented step to unify efforts on major projects across industries.

The Premiers want to connect Western oil and gas to new and existing refineries in southern Ontario and northern ports in James Bay. 

The plan also includes linking Ontario's critical minerals in the Ring of Fire region to new ports in Western Canada.

Ford called it ""an amazing day"" for the provinces and the country. 

Ford said when Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan come together, they send a clear message that Canada is ready to build.

All three premiers criticized federal regulations they say block development. 

They want the federal government to remove what they call barriers to nation building projects.

Smith specifically targeted several federal laws, including Bill C-69, the oil and gas emissions cap, the tanker ban, and net zero vehicle and electricity mandates. 

Smith said these ""anti-resource, anti-development laws"" prevent provinces from attracting investment and project partners.

The Premiers argue that removing these regulations would help Canada achieve Prime Minister Mark Carney's goal of becoming a global energy superpower. 

Moe said Saskatchewan's products need access to more countries around the world to provide food security, energy security, and manufacturing security.

Ford warned that projects keep getting ""tied up in red tape, regulation, delayed, blocked, and then cancelled."" 

Ford said the world needs what Canada has, and it's time to think big about bringing critical minerals, oil, and natural gas to new markets globally.

The agreement includes plans to work in partnership with indigenous communities on all projects. 

Ford emphasized that construction would use Ontario-made and Saskatchewan-made steel, creating jobs and attracting investment.

The three premiers presented a united front in calling for federal cooperation on their shared economic goals.

1m6due4,Cutting off friends/family due to political beleifs,25,Canoe-Whisperer,62,2025-07-22T13:17:20+00:00,"Good morning

I've noticed an influx of posts on Reddit that are on the topic of ""Stopped talking to this person because they supported MAGA"" ""dumped my now ex cuz he/she supports Trump"" or even worse ""divorced my spouse because they support orange man"" etc.

What are your thoughts on this?

Do you feel Canada is headed in this direction?

Have you experienced this with your fellow countryman or friends/family south of the border?

No need to mention I have been super disappointed with each of federal elections since JT got in. I didn't cut off ties with anyone (I'll admit some awkward convo's with family members that led to some resentment but we are still cordial and time has allowed this awkwardness to dissipate a little) and I certainly didn't take a ""selfie video"" of myself crying that Carney got in, or Trudeau held a minority, whatever.

If PP where elected, do you think Canadian liberals would post ""crying selfie videos""?

Interested in your takes and stories. Have a great day.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1m6due4/cutting_off_friendsfamily_due_to_political_beleifs/,CanadianConservative,0.74,Discussion,False
1m6dduq,Tracey Wilson from CCFR on why we lost.,18,OffTheRails999,24,2025-07-22T12:57:21+00:00,"[https://x.com/TWilsonOttawa/status/1947635012276277546](https://x.com/TWilsonOttawa/status/1947635012276277546)

Why we lose   
  
The left is ruthless, organized and united. I mean, look what they did to win. They absolutely decimated one of their own parties, the NDP. People who voted dipper for generations abandoned their party and stacked up, with their elbows and all, behind the new Liberal leader. Because winning was more important to them than us.   
  
In any other election, 41% of the vote would have been a majority for us. But, they threw their morals, policies and principles out the window. They abandoned ideas they’ve simped for and defended relentlessly all along and pivoted on a dime. Carbon tax? Gone. A sudden patriotism for the flag they used to be embarrassed by. Elbows up for everything Canadiana by people who’ve spent the last 10 years bowing to China and other foreign influences.   
  
They pivoted on defence spending, interprovincial trade, climate change and now crime and bail and a myriad of other issues. They’ve convinced people to literally hate our largest trading partner who’s provided us security and prosperity.   
  
And they’ll keep winning with this strategy because they’re not married to their conscience.   
  
The right can’t compromise. Can’t unite. Can’t control their impulse to be outraged if their leader doesn’t bend to their own rage mob.   
  
Keep waving the flag of virtuous “principles” and they’ll keep waving the flag of victory.

Elections Canada says over 120,000 mail-in ballots from the April 28 general election were never counted, raising new questions about voting irregularities and transparency.

The agency said 1,321,449 mail-in ballots were issued but only 1,200,808 were tallied. It did not explain whether the 120,641 missing ballots were unused or returned too late.

*Blacklock's Reporter* says the disclosure follows earlier apologies for uncounted ballots left at a returning office in Coquitlam, B.C. and mislabeling of ballots in Terrebonne, Que., where Liberals won an unexpected seat by a single vote.

Bloc MPs say they want answers.

“We are demanding transparency from Elections Canada,” said MP Sébastien Lemire (Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Que.).

House affairs committee members have summoned Chief Electoral Officer Stéphane Perrault to testify.

Perrault has previously admitted “unfortunate” irregularities in the 2021 election, when 123,000 ballots were mailed too late for voters to return them by deadline and another 90,000 were disqualified as late returns.

Concerns are also being raised about low turnout in ridings like Abitibi-Baie James-Nunavik-Eeyou, where only 47.6% of voters cast ballots amid complaints of unexplained poll closures.

The House affairs committee earlier rejected a proposal to allow Canadians to vote by phone. The 2021 report, backed by Liberal MPs, argued for exploring smartphone voting. Bloc MPs opposed it, warning of voter fraud risks and difficulties verifying identity.

I feel like instead of the elections being about our economy, it was about hating Trump and honestly I hate Trump, I think he sucks, and I desperately want him to stop saying he thinks we are ""51st state"" material and chill out with the tariffs because it's making hiring decisions extremely unpredictable. You can't make hiring decisions if you genuinely don't know what the next quarter will be like economically. 

I'm so sad and annoyed. I really want to ask the people in Pierre's new riding to vote him in so he gets second chance, but it's 100% immoral to tell people who to vote for.

I recently saw a poll that suggested about 37% of Albertans supported succession from the rest of Canada, and about 26% even supported joining the US. The same poll suggested a similar sentiment exists in all the prairie provinces, though to a lesser extent than Alberta. 

Based on my very limited interactions and online discussions with Albertans, they come off politically almost like Texans (from a much colder climate).

I confess that as an American, the idea of adding Alberta to the US is intriguing as it would give us more territory rich in natural resources as well as a passionate and more conservative leaning voter base. 

However, I also recognize the multiple logistical challenges with something like this. And I more than sympathize with Albertans who truly identify as Canadian or Albertan and would prefer to remain in the country or be independent.

I’m wondering what some of you think about this “movement” taking place in the Western (specifically prairie) provinces. They seem to have very legitimate issues with the government in Ottawa and I’m wondering where all this might be going. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not advocating for any hostile annexation of Canadian territory by the US government/military. I’m merely asking about a theoretically territorial change that has potential movement behind it based on recent polling data.

To start this off, I've known this woman for almost 3 years now.  We are not related nor work together and met through both happening to sign up for (in a sense) charity work for the same organization.  Neither one of us talked politics at all (up until the federal election) aside from her bringing up Trump here and there and how horrible he was.

Just so people can get a better picture of this woman's background: Canadian-born with some distant,  relations to Britain/UK. She lives in a gorgeous fully-detached home on a street full of gorgeous fully-detached homes where everyone's front and back yard look like botanical gardens. There is a lake in the center of this particular community.

Not going to be too specific (for obvious reasons) but the whole town lies close to water and in total, I think I saw 3 non-white people around even when we drove into downtown to check out some popular local summer destinations. Almost all the homes I saw were either gorgeous historical homes or gorgeous brand spanking new 1.5 to 2.5 million dollar mansions.

There were gated communities as well. I am telling you, these people live in a reality where crime, drugs, violence on the rise due to immigration from certain cultures and poverty like people using food banks is just something they see on tv; Something that exists but is just the 'news story' of the day as if they are isolated instances and not every day life for a huge portion of Canada.

**Leading up to Trump becoming president:**

Endless lecture-like venting over everything that he has done (some exaggerated but some not) and that he is clinically a sociopath and needs to be barred from office. This wasn't said in jest; she genuinely believes he is unwell and probably refusing to get officially diagnosed.

**Once Mark Carney showed up on the scene:**

Holy, ever living hell did this woman just fall in love with this guy. I met with her just after Carney came into the picture and he hadn't even said much of anything and immediately this woman defaulted to 'saviour of Canada'.

When I came over sometime in February, she had CNN running the entire time of the visit with endless, endless converge of Carney as if the entirety of Canadian politics was just 'Mark Carney' now and nothing else - not even which political party he represented. It's like it didn't matter; Carney was presented as a Canadian superman.

She was and continues to be absolutely charmed (blindly) by his connections to Europe and England and his work as governor of the Bank of England. *\*More on this later*.

**Post election reaction to Carney's governing:**

Everything he is doing is perfect. She insisted that 'he is still the right man for the moment' (Lib talking point) but couldn't really name anything he has done that she specifically thinks makes him the right man for the moment. More tirades about Trump. She was much better versed in what Trump was doing in America than in what Carney is doing in Canada.

**On the government finding new taxes to take money away from people, especially seniors who are about to retire or have retired:**

Agrees that the government will find sneaky ways to do this, agrees taxes are too high. But this was said in a way that makes it seem like she doesn't think Carney has any control over this - as if Mark Carney and 'the government' are two separate entities.

**On the UK, Poland and EU:**

Said Poland was the country that is currently thriving the most as far as countries that are part of the EU. - now ""Poland is almost as successful as the UK."" FYI, for those who are reading but aren't aware, Poland has been doing surprisingly well lately, especially compared to the UK. Its economy is growing steadily, and people there are getting more wealthy each year. While inflation has been an issue, Poland has kept its national debt low and managed its money carefully. The UK, on the other hand, has been struggling with slow growth, Brexit problems, and unstable politics. Polls show that Polish people are feeling more hopeful about the future than people in the UK. Big companies are also putting more money into Poland, especially in tech and manufacturing. Poland is building up its roads, trains, and cities fast, while the UK is falling behind on public services. All in all, Poland looks like a country moving forward, while the UK seems stuck.

But it's like she still has this 1980s view of *just* the UK and isn't quite aware of how far the UK and Europe in general have fallen in the last decade.

When I said (very gently) that one of the biggest reasons Poland is so successful (and what actually goes AGAINST the EU) is Poland’s cautious approach to immigration and that they are careful not to let in extremists and people from violent cultures, she made a joke out of this and said ""Oh so you mean Americans ahahahah""  . . ..  like what? No, it's not roaming gangs of Americans that are going around and raping women in Europe Susan. Anyway, onto the next point.

**Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives**

Much like not being able to say what Carney has done since becoming PM that still makes him 'the right man for the job', she was not able to say anything constructive about why Pierre shouldn't be the Prime Minister other than Liberal talking points of 'he's just an attack dog' and 'he's never had a job outside of politics'. When I said 'well Singh was a lawyer and look what he did to the NDP' she just said 'yeah I guess you're right' but nothing more. When I said 'Pierre is fantastic on domestic policies, better than Carney, and that's what we need to strengthen to avoid Trump walking all over us' she insisted that due to Carney having world experience (which I guess means outside of Canada) this is what positions him better at dealing with Trump . . . despite Carney having ZERO experience with dealing with Trump as a politician and not a businessman in a boardroom which is a whole different ball game and despite Carney completely failing so far.

**Longest Ballot**

This protest has no meaning to her and she didn't even refer to this as the situation with the Longest Ballot committee - she started out by saying 'did you see what they're doing to him in that new riding?? You'd think the guy would get a clue and the Conservatives would get rid of him now that they've done this twice lol""

Just a reminder, she has no clue about the extent of my opinions and this was said to me unprompted. This is just how average boomer voters view the Longest Ballot protest.

. . .

But let's go back to when I was speaking about her being charmed by Mark Carney's connection to Europe and the UK. Ironically, she was trying to get me into watching The Gilded Age. Another FYI for those who don't know, the Gilded Age was a period in American history (roughly from the 1870s to about 1900) marked by rapid economic growth, industrialization, and the rise of big business. But it was a time of enormous wealth for only a small group of powerful elites (like Carnegies, Rockefellers, and Vanderbilts) while many others lived in poverty and worked in harsh conditions. The name “Gilded Age” comes from the idea that society looked golden and great on the outside but was actually full of corruption, inequality, and exploitation underneath. It was also a time of political scandals, weak regulation, and growing tension between workers and industrialists . . . .  like I can't even make this shit up.

As much as on an individual level, people like this boomer woman are nice and seem like they care, don't let that fool you; They are this [person](https://ibb.co/Vh9BC10) and believe me, unless you are this person too, the Mark Carney Liberals (because this is specific to Carney) will not do anything at all to help your current situation.

To her and others like her, this current government lead by Mark Carney is that aristocratic version of government from 'the days of yore' that they view as noble and of a time when men were Lords and people were 'proper'. Why do you think Carney brought in the damn King of England for the Throne Speech - it was for people like her. **This demographic makes up 70% of the voting block.**

These people do not live in our current reality. They quite literally live in their ivory tower, looking down at the rest of Canada and saying 'pff it's not even that bad down there! These people need to stop complaining!' and they've convinced other poorer and working class Canadian voters that 'we're all in this together'.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1m4uv5o/i_talked_to_a_typical_carney_white_wealthy_female/,CanadianConservative,0.76,Opinion,False

This man was trying to get into her house, banging on doors and windows.

This man smashed a glass booze bottle on my driveway, broke my neighbour's items and sloshed about drunk as a skunk.

I set off alarms, it woke up the neighborhood, this man did not budge.

We called the police, me along with several neighbours, it was 1:00 AM.

I stayed up all night making sure he didn't try to get into her house but I was not going to confront him, we didn't even know if there was more than one of them.

The police said they would send someone. The police did not arrive until 12:00 PM that day. 

When he finally left (it was just one guy talking to himself all night) he stumbled away (around 11:00 AM) to the neighbours telling him to leave, and as he left he just walked up to people's vehicles, in plain site of everyone, trying to break into them. He then weaved in and out of houses and back lanes until we lost site of them.

I have several firearms, non lethal rounds, and other defensive weapons. 

Here's the thing: They are all useless in Canada.

I was helpless. I knew if I shot this guy I would lose everything. I knew if I confronted him/them I would be vulnerable and the law would see me as the aggressor, as I should have left them to do whatever they wanted. 

What does a Canadian do? How can I defend my family and neighborhood if the police cannot? I understand they are overworked, so how about another option where the good guys don't get screwed?

We need laws that protect Canadian citizens who are defending thier homes and themselves. I don't want to fear jail time when there is a criminal who will get off with nothing.

I'm trying to create a new polling system, and I want to make sure I have a balance of people and perspectives, so I'm posting this to all the main subs of political views. I believe the voting system of FPTP is corrupt, and it's embarrassing that the liberal government ran on voting reform until they revealed they only wanted voter reform that was rigged in their favor (instant runoff ballots where basically all Green Party and NDP votes automatically funnel to Liberals if the NDP or Greens don't outright win). I want to see a voter system that actually captures the expression of voters, by letting voters score all parties from -10 to 10, letting people express active hostility towards candidates they feel have failed.

This system gets rid of the spoiler effect, greatly reduces strategic voting and the 2 party system, and is theorized to actually reduce mudslinging politics. By allowing many many candidates on the ballot, politicians would have to work harder to produce enough negative material while also fueling their own positive angles, that focusing on self promotion becomes more efficient/rewarded. This system is designed to favor the party that everyone likes moderately, instead of whichever candidate can turn out the most quantity of extreme voters in the FPTP system, which should also reduce polarity.

If you would like to [fill out a mock ballot](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5Yhrs7PG88NvJPO580_8Q7xyLQpbwtujUHq5PXw8OfDGsUQ/viewform?usp=dialog), I'm running a test beside the first past the post system (the last question) to compare results.

1m3bfk2,Alberta’s Heritage Fund hits record $30 billion after major boost,16,84brucew,8,2025-07-18T19:22:23+00:00,"Now imagine Alberta's wealth without, ""transfer payments"" and constant attempts by ottawa to stifle Alberta's prosperity.    Saskatchewan has nowhere near that wealth, but a lot of untapped and stifled resources, plus the majority of canada's arable land.  

Sad part is the maritimes could be wealthy as well, were they to reclaim the territorial fishing grounds the liberals have given to china and run with their offshore resources.

Seems to me all of our real problem is ottawa, toronto and quebec.  Just food for thought.

Link at btm:

Alberta’s Heritage Savings Trust Fund has reached an all-time high of $30 billion after a $2.8 billion contribution from the province’s 2024-25 surplus, the government announced Friday.

Premier Danielle Smith called the milestone a bold step toward securing Alberta’s future.

“By growing the Heritage Fund, we’re strengthening core services like health care and education, while preserving the low-tax Alberta advantage,” she said.

“This $2.8 billion boost sets the province on the path to success and puts Albertans first.”

The Alberta government aims to grow the fund to $250 billion by 2050.

Once that target is reached, annual interest will be used to stabilize volatile resource revenue, spend on infrastructure, and help maintain Canada’s lowest tax environment.

Nate Horner, President of Treasury Board and Minister of Finance, said the move “strengthens Alberta’s financial stronghold” and is a key part of building a “prosperous future with stable revenues and competitive taxes.”

The province recently launched a long-term strategy titled *Renewing the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund: A Roadmap to Securing Alberta’s Future*, outlining plans to grow the fund through strategic spending, global partnerships, and modernized governance.

Central to that plan is the Heritage Fund Opportunities Corporation, chaired by Joe Lougheed, which will steer investment decisions independently from government and connect Alberta to international financial opportunities.

“Our role is to ensure the Heritage Fund is managed with the highest standards of governance and independence,” said Lougheed.

According to the province, the fund has grown more than 84% since 2019-20, when it sat at $16.3 billion, and over 41.5% since 2022-23, when it was valued at $21.2 billion.

The board overseeing the fund includes Alberta-based directors as well as international members from Switzerland and Finland.

1m3adz5,50K+ jobs to foreign workers in Q1. Why?,31,resting16,11,2025-07-18T18:41:18+00:00,"The Q1 list of Liberal approved applications for temporary foreign workers is out. Read the List of Shame and weep. 
Last month, the federal government quietly released the list of positive Labour Market Impact Assessments (LMIAs) approved in the first quarter of 2025.
What this data revealed - particularly given the current economic climate and declining public sentiment towards immigration - is objectively insane.
Regardless of your political leanings, this data is bound to provoke you into fits of despair. From labour unions to unemployed young Canadians, it should ignite alarm over the government’s use of immigration policy to stymy the ability of Canadians to find jobs. One group, however, stands to benefit: corporations that exploit government policies that foster a low-wage underclass in order to turn a profit.
For those unfamiliar with the terminology often used in immigration policy, here's a quick overview. In Canada, employers seeking to hire temporary foreign workers (TFWs) typically require a positive LMIA from the federal government before a work permit can be granted. In principle, the LMIA process ensures that importing a foreign worker for a specific role does not deprive a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of that job opportunity.
In practice, over the years this has proven to not been the case, and this most recent data proves how broken this supposed failsafe to ensure Canadians get jobs actually is.
This most recent data shows that in the first quarter of 2025 alone, over 50,000 Canadian job opportunities were approved by the federal Liberals to be filled with TFWs. Over 30,000 of those fell outside legitimately difficult to fill seasonal, non-permanent primary agriculture roles like food harvesting and processing. Within the low-wage TFW stream - for positions like food service workers, for example - the federal Liberal government approved over a mind-blowing 15,000 temporary foreign workers in the first quarter of this year alone. Even more concerning, approvals for purely numbered companies (often shell entities with minimal transparency) totaled close to 4,000 positions (when excluding seasonal agriculture).
The Q1 LMIA approvals span arguably unjustifiable categories, including immigration services businesses themselves hiring TFWs for marketing and administrative roles, blue-chip corporations like McDonald's filling food worker positions, and hands-on sectors approving truck drivers and cooks - all while qualified Canadians struggle with simultaneous jobs and affordability crises.
These absurd LMIAs decisions have the potential to:
Exacerbate unemployment, particularly among youth, whose unemployment rate stands at 14.2% (and even higher among returning students, 17.4%.)
Directly suppress wages by artificially increasing the supply of labour amidst unemployment and inflation crises
Remove vital opportunities for Canadian youth to learn entry level job skills, thereby creating long-term career setbacks as the economy is being transformed by Artificial Intelligence
Enable and exacerbate proven exploitation of foreign workers.
The Q1 List of Shame
To illustrate the dysfunction, consider these (few) examples (there are many, many more, and I encourage you to look through the list yourself):
Companies and public sector entities that got approved to hire entry-level and food services labour:
Image
Companies and public sector entities that got approved to hire white collar jobs with TFWs (my personal favourite here is the Grain Growers of Canada (a lobby group) receiving a positive LMIA decision for a communications position….come on guys, for real??):
Image
Immigration consulting firms that often help companies get approved for TFWs got approved for TWFs too:
Image
Companies that got approval to fill trades jobs with TFWs:
Image
The arguments that many companies most commonly use to justify their use of the TFW program (particularly the low-skilled stream) are that:
Canadians don’t want to do the work
That only a foreigner could do the job, or
That government benefit programs often prevent people from taking jobs.
In many cases, these arguments wouldn’t pass the smell test for an ordinary Canadian, so they shouldn’t for the Liberal government either.
In reality, outside of a very few regions where unemployment levels significantly defy the current national rate of 6.9%, and in certain segments of the seasonal agricultural industry, many of these jobs can and should go to available Canadians. And, there won’t be change unless the Liberals stop buying into bunk arguments for temporary foreign labour and find ways to reform the program, or, as the case may be, incent Canadians to work. Wages that aren’t suppressed by an open floodgate of low skilled temporary foreign labour would probably be a good place to start.
Ironically, on that front, all the Liberals had to do upon taking office in 2015 was not bend to the will of powerful corporate lobbyists clamouring for the reversals of program changes made by the former Harper Conservative government. I was in cabinet at the time and remember the gnashing of teeth and wailing from employers that were accused of seriously abusing the program.
Nonetheless and to his credit, Jason Kenney, as Minister of Employment and Social Development, introduced major reforms to the TFW program and LMIA process in 2013 and 2014. In 2013, key changes included requiring employers to pay temporary foreign workers at prevailing wages, introducing processing fees for LMIA applications, extending job advertising periods to recruit Canadians first, and adding scrutiny on outsourcing impacts. The 2014 overhaul was more comprehensive: it imposed a 10% cap on low-wage foreign workers per worksite (phased in from higher limits), barred low-wage hires in regions with unemployment above 6%, limited low-wage worker stays to two years, introduced moratoriums in sectors like food services, boosted inspections and fines for violations, and split the TFW program from the International Mobility Program to reduce overall reliance on foreign labor, leading to an 80% drop in low-skilled approvals.
But after taking power in 2015, the Liberal government caved to pressure and almost immediately rolled back many of these changes. By 2022, changes included raising the low-wage worker cap to 20% for most employers and 30% for sectors like food services (from 10%), eliminating automatic LMIA refusals in sectors like accommodation, food, and retail, removing limits on low-wage hires in certain seasonal industries, extending LMIA validity from 9 to 18 months, and increasing maximum employment durations for high-wage workers to three years. These adjustments contributed to a 70% surge in temporary foreign workers, from about 324,000 in 2015 to over 549,000 by 2021, effectively reversing much of the prior tightening.
Fast forward to today, in the midst of a national youth employment crisis and an economic modality change precipitated by artificial intelligence, the Liberal government is still juicing the approval of permits for jobs that Canadians should be filling, and still caving to powerful corporate lobby groups who profit from suppressed wages by filling jobs that should be filled by Canadians with temporary foreign labour.
Conservatives believe in reducing the number of TFWs and setting a hard rule that Canadians must always come first for Canadian jobs.

1m2zzkv,Actual data based comparison between cost and quality of life - Canada vs USA?,5,OffTheRails999,45,2025-07-18T11:38:02+00:00,"Does anyone, or can anyone put me onto an unbiased comparison between COL in Canada vs USA?  
Recently got raked over the coals in another thread for suggesting that the grass may be greener in the USA but nowhere near as green as some think.  I base this solely on the fact that I have a ton of family in the USA and when talking to them, I don't really see the huge difference.  Seems so many ""conservatives"" are acting like US celebs and saying they want to bail on their country because they don't like the government.   
Does anyone have a solid, fact and data based, unbiased comparison of the two countries?    
For example.....cousin of mine in New Jersey, four years ago making the same money I did. We talked at great length and really came down to maybe 5% difference.  Again, that was not scientific.   
And yes, I can Google, but was hoping one of the smart folks here could shortcut that for me.  
Especially since countless people shit-kicked me for my opinion, I would think many have costed this down to the penny and know why they want out.

1m2mwd0,America’s Biggest Medical Facility for Transgender Youth Is Shutting Down,13,84brucew,0,2025-07-17T23:33:58+00:00,"Posting because like it or not, what happens in the US generally happens here within 4 years.  Point being you pedophile's/child groomers/perverts and masochists day in the sun is over.  Time to crawl back under your disgusting slimy rock so the Massive majority of us can get back to sanity, morals and family.  This has nothing to do with gay people, this is about eliminating the pervert's.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), the nation’s largest provider of gender procedures for youth identifying as transgender, announced it will shut down its program on July 22, citing mounting legal and financial pressures stemming from the Trump administration’s policies.

In a recent [statement](https://www.chla.org/adolescent-and-young-adult-medicine/center-transyouth-health-and-development), CHLA described the decision as “heartbreaking” for staff, adding that it followed a thorough legal and financial review in light of “the increasingly severe impacts of recent administrative actions and proposed policies.”

The planned closure has led to demonstrations outside CHLA in recent days, with protester Sage Sol Pitchenik telling The Associated Press that “trans kids are done being quiet” and that a facility like CHLA “meant the world” for transgender youth.

CHLA’s announcement comes in the context of President Donald Trump’s [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/), issued shortly after his second term began in January, which bars federal support for gender transition procedures for individuals under 19.

Trump’s order said such treatments—including puberty blockers and surgeries—are medically risky and potentially irreversible, stating that many minors lack the maturity to fully grasp the long-term consequences. It also prohibits federal insurance programs like Tricare and Medicaid from covering these treatments, directs the Department of Justice to pursue legal action against providers, and suspends funding for hospitals and universities offering transgender procedures, which it described as “chemical and surgical mutilation.”

Following the order, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) [issued](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/white-house-pauses-federal-grants-loans-5799878) a directive suspending federal grants, loans, and financial assistance related to transgender programs pending further review. In response, a coalition of 23 state attorneys general [sued](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.58912/gov.uscourts.rid.58912.1.0.pdf) in federal court to block the OMB directive, arguing that the funding freeze was unlawful.Related Stories[Supreme Court Says the Constitution Does Not Second-Guess the People on ‘Gender-Affirming’ Care](https://www.theepochtimes.com/opinion/supreme-court-says-the-constitution-does-not-second-guess-the-people-on-gender-affirming-care-5875641?ea_src=author_manual&ea_med=related_stories)[Supreme Court Upholds Tennessee’s Ban on ‘Gender-Affirming Care’ for Minors](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-upholds-tennessees-ban-on-gender-affirming-care-for-minors-5867052?ea_src=author_manual&ea_med=related_stories)Meanwhile, CHLA’s imminent closure follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s [recent](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-upholds-tennessees-ban-on-gender-affirming-care-for-minors-5867052) 6–3 ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on gender-related medical treatments for minors—a decision that [could support](https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/5-takeaways-from-supreme-court-decision-on-gender-affirming-care-5874891) similar laws nationwide.Tennessee’s law [prohibits](https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/title-68/health/chapter-33/section-68-33-103/) health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones for the purpose of “enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex” or “treating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity.”Chief Justice John Roberts [wrote](https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/5-takeaways-from-supreme-court-decision-on-gender-affirming-care-5874891) in the opinion that such state laws need only meet a “rational basis” test, suggesting that similar restrictions in other states will probably withstand legal challenges. Roberts said Tennessee’s law focuses on age, not sex-based discrimination, and cited concerns about the risks and irreversible impacts of transgender medical procedures for minors.Several other hospitals, including facilities in Colorado, Illinois, Virginia, and Washington, DC, have also [paused](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/some-hospitals-stop-transgender-surgeries-on-children-after-trumps-order-5802015) transgender procedures for minors in response to the evolving legal landscape.Rush University Medical Center in Illinois recently became the latest Chicago-area hospital to stop transgender procedures for minors, with a spokesperson [telling](https://www.wbez.org/health-medicine/2025/07/16/rush-medical-center-halts-gender-affirming-care-for-new-patients-under-18) WBEZ Chicago that Rush had “paused” hormonal care for new patients under 18, though it will continue to provide mental health services to transgender youth.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1m2mwd0/americas_biggest_medical_facility_for_transgender/,CanadianConservative,0.76,News,False

1m0pwep,Mark Carney’s fiscal fantasy will bankrupt Canada,59,84brucew,20,2025-07-15T18:38:13+00:00,"**Gwyn Morgan is a retired business leader who was a director of five global corporations**

Mark Carney was supposed to be the adult in the room. After nearly a decade of runaway spending under Justin Trudeau, the former central banker was presented to Canadians as a steady hand — someone who could responsibly manage the economy and restore fiscal discipline.

Instead, Carney has taken Trudeau’s recklessness and dialled it up. His government’s [recently released spending plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/planned-government-spending/government-expenditure-plan-main-estimates/2025-26-estimates.html) shows an increase of 8.5 per cent this fiscal year to $437.8 billion. Add in “non-budgetary spending” such as EI payouts, plus at least $49 billion just to service the burgeoning national debt and total spending in Carney’s first year in office will hit $554.5 billion.  

Even if tax revenues were to remain level with last year — and they almost certainly won’t, given the tariff wars ravaging Canadian industry — we are hurtling toward a deficit that could easily exceed three per cent of GDP, and thus dwarf our meagre annual economic growth.

It will only get worse. The Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates debt interest alone will consume $70 billion annually by 2029. Fitch Ratings recently warned of Canada’s “rapid and steep fiscal deterioration,” noting that if the Liberal program is implemented total federal, provincial and local debt would rise to 90 per cent of GDP.

This was already a fiscal powder keg. But then Carney casually tossed in a lit match. At June’s NATO summit, he pledged to raise defence spending to two per cent of GDP this fiscal year — to roughly $62 billion. Days later, he stunned even his own caucus by promising to match NATO’s new five per cent target. If he and his Liberal colleagues follow through, Canada’s defence spending will balloon to the current annual equivalent of $155 billion per year. There is no plan to pay for this. It will all go on the national credit card.

This is not “responsible government.” It is economic madness.

And it’s happening amid broader economic decline. Business investment per worker — a key driver of productivity and living standards — has been shrinking since 2015. The C.D. Howe Institute warns that Canadian workers are increasingly “under-equipped compared to their peers abroad,” making us less competitive and less prosperous.

The problem isn’t a lack of money; it’s a lack of discipline and vision. We’ve created a business climate that punishes investment: high taxes, sluggish regulatory processes, and politically motivated uncertainty. Carney has done nothing to reverse this. If anything, he’s making the situation worse.

Recall the 2008 global financial meltdown. Carney loves to highlight his role as Bank of Canada Governor during that time but the true credit for steering the country through the crisis belongs to then-prime minister Stephen Harper and his finance minister, Jim Flaherty. Facing the pressures of a minority parliament, they made the tough decisions that safeguarded Canada’s fiscal foundation. Their disciplined governance is something Carney would do well to emulate.

Instead, he’s tearing down that legacy. His recent $4.3 billion aid pledge to Ukraine, made without parliamentary approval, exemplifies his careless approach. And his self-proclaimed image as the experienced technocrat who could go eyeball-to-eyeball against Trump is starting to crack.

[Instead of respecting Carney, Trump is almost toying with him, announcing in June, for example that the U.S. would pull out of the much-ballyhooed bilateral trade talks launched at the G7 Summit less than two weeks earlier.](https://westernstandard.quintype.com/story/91864936-37ae-4796-9f77-48c66d4bbf43)

Ordinary Canadians will foot the bill for Carney’s fiscal mess. The dollar has weakened. Young Canadians — already priced out of the housing market — will inherit a mountain of debt. This is not stewardship. It’s generational theft.

Some still believe Carney will pivot — that he will eventually govern sensibly. But nothing in his actions supports that hope. A leader serious about economic renewal would cancel wasteful Trudeau-era programs, streamline approvals for energy and resource projects, and offer incentives for capital investment. Instead, we’re getting more borrowing and ideological showmanship.

It’s no longer credible to say Carney is better than Trudeau. He’s worse. Trudeau at least pretended deficits were temporary. Carney has made them permanent — and more dangerous.

This is a betrayal of the fiscal stability Canadians were promised. If we care about our credit rating, our standard of living, or the future we are leaving our children, we must change course. That begins by removing a government unwilling — or unable — to do the job.

Canada once set an economic example for others. Those days are gone. The warning signs — soaring debt, declining productivity, and diminished global standing — are everywhere. Carney’s defenders may still hope he can grow into the job. Canada cannot afford to wait and find out.

1m0k7i4,Carney and his investments which he hid from Canadians,36,Archiebonker12345,7,2025-07-15T15:05:54+00:00,"During the election, Mark Carney assured Canadians that his financial holdings were limited to cash and real estate. He says he doesn’t know what was inside the blind trust, but was the one who bought the stock. Now according to the ethics disclosures, those claims were misleading. The disclosure reveals that Carney holds 574 separate stock positions with 91% based in the United States, and only 0.5% are based in Canada. He’s now required to recuse himself from decisions involving around 100 companies.

Why has the ethics commissioner taken such extreme measures forcing a full disclosure? Because Mark Carney’s wealth is deeply entangled in many U.S. companies and tech giants. These aren’t holdings like index funds, these are investments that thrive on the health of the American economy. If the American economy were to go bust then so would his investments.

The leadership of a Prime Minister means placing the needs of our nation above yourself. When Canadian and American interests clash, do you trust Mark Carney to fight for Canadian industry when his own vast fortune relies on us losing. Canada deserves a leader whose future rises and falls with the nation, not someone whose fortune relies on the country that is threatening our sovereignty. 

So this brings up the obvious question: If Canada were to enter a trade war with the U.S., whose side would Carney really be on? The side of Canadian workers or his portfolio, his record so far offers little reassurance. 

Mark Carney’s policy platform during the election conveniently aligns with his business interests. Praising nuclear energy and Westinghouse, which was acquired by Brookfield while he was in a senior position. Promoting housing policy relating to modular homes that directly supports Brookfield-owned companies like Modulaire.

The report released by the Ethics Commissioner shows that Carney holds shares in Big Tech titans like Google, Amazon, Netflix, Meta, and Microsoft, all companies that lobbied aggressively against Canada’s Digital Service Tax because it threatened to cost them millions. Then when pressure came from Washington, Carney folded, scrapping the tax that would have hurt those companies. To be clear, we supported abolishing this tax, but the circumstances under which it was abolished were bizarre. Was this simply a bargaining chip, or is something deeper at play? 

Canadians may never get the full story, but they shouldn’t be forced to speculate while decisions that affect their livelihoods unfold behind closed doors. Canadians deserve a leader whose judgement isn’t clouded by personal foreign investments, whose loyalty is completely anchored in Canada, and who is allowed to participate in any discussion.

Pierre lost his seat obviously, so he’s now running in the by-election in the riding of Battle-River Crowfoot, Alberta. Guess how many candidates are on the ballot *so far? Over 200. 

Coincidence this happens twice? Nope. Little unknown fact: 85 of the 91 candidates on the Carleton riding ballot were all signed up in the last few days one was able to, and all by the same organization.

The group “The Largest Ballot Committee” is intentionally behind it. They’ve done this in a handful of by-elections before, and in every one of them I’ve looked into so far (with the exception of one), the election resulted in the riding flipping. Now, correlation doesn’t equal causation, so I’m going through and analyzing the data and comparing it to past elections in those ridings to see what’s going on. 

But back to this longest ballot committee and my legal question. Their stated purpose on their website is to “protest the first-past-the-post electoral system.” What they’ve done in practice is not that. The FPTP electoral system applies to all of Canada and its 343 ridings, yet they’ve only targeted a handful of specific (by)election ridings over a span of 4 or so years. If they were indeed using this form of action to protest a nation-wide system, wouldn’t the protest be, uh, nationwide? If this was/is sincerely their motivation, wouldn’t they have done it in more than just one riding this election? Out of 343 ridings, they chose only 1 to do this to, which just so happened to be the most consequential riding this past election. 

To me that’s a pretty easy argument to make. They ain’t protesting. The definitions of what they say they’re doing and what they’re actually doing are incongruent. Unless they admit they’re total failures at their own stated purpose, which is to protest a nationwide system.

Moreover, they’ve done this not just once but twice now to the same political candidate. It’s not my opinion that they’re targeting Pierre, it’s a fact. Now, protesting specific people is a thing, but there’s no sound argument to be made to target Pierre in “protest”of the FPTP system.
Pierre ain’t the one who gave us the FPTP system; he’s not responsible for its continuation, he can’t single handedly change it, and he’s not even in the party that campaigned on electoral reform and then didn’t follow through. 

Can this group not be gone after legally in some way? I think it wouldn’t be hard to make the argument that they’re targeting a political candidate and engaging in election interference, not protest. 

 85 of the 91 candidates on the Carleton riding ballot were signed up in the last few (I think it was 3) days of eligibility, and every single one of them were approached, asked, and encouraged by The Longest Ballot Committee to sign up to be a candidate on the ballot. 

It is legal to sign up as an independent candidate on the ballot. As far as I’m aware that can’t be prevented. But election interference is not legal, and I think the case could made that that’s exactly what they’re doing. Is there some way to legally bar the registration of an individual to become an electoral candidate if they’ve been asked/persuaded by this group to do it not at their own behest but at that of the group? If a person registers to be on the ballot because they were recruited by this group to do so, is that registration by/of the individual not being done in bad faith? 

Is there any legal case or action that can be made/taken against this group for its actions, practices, and false representation? ",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1m0a51u/any_lawyers_on_here_i_have_an_electionrelated/,CanadianConservative,0.72,Discussion,False

1lypphu,Poilievre lost because he was too Canadian,105,BodyMother,157,2025-07-13T10:37:23+00:00,"I know this sounds bitter and like cope. Maybe it is. But I’ve been sitting with the election results for months now, absorbing all the numbers and behavior from voters, media and even the conservative party. And the more I look at it, the more it becomes obvious;

Pierre Poilevre lost because he was too Canadian for the country Canada has become. 

He didn’t run a dirty campaign. He didn’t go full culture war. He didn’t demonize minorities or immigrants, just called for responsible policy and reinvestment to our domestic population. He didn’t demonize even the liberals or Carney or Trudeau that much. He didn’t pander to racists. He didn’t try to ‘Trumpify’ a damn thing besides loving his country. He didn’t sell mass hatred. He focused on the economy, housing, inflation, youth unemployment, tearing down trade barriers between provinces, actual damn solutions.

And he got fucking dragged through the mud for it. He got called far right - for saying we need to prioritise our own Canadians and do our best to clean up our streets and make people feel safe in their own country again. He got called a greedy private sector cruel money baron for wanting lower taxes and less bureaucratic bloat and corruption. He got accused constantly of being Trump 2.0, who would sell the country to America even though he publicly made statements condemning Trump, the trade threats and took a hardline stance. And why?

Because he did something every Canadian used to do. Speak politely and reasonably. Work hard. Debate respectfully and put policy before emotion. 

He got 41 percent of the popular vote, and 144 seats. The Liberals got 43 percent - with every urban media engine on their side, the CBC publicly on their payroll - and 169. Not even a majority. And now I keep hearing even from his own base that he should’ve gone harder, for not ‘being aggressive enough’. 

He chose not to run on division. He chose not to scapegoat immigrants entirely. He chose to believe Canada was still a functioning democracy which responded to facts and actions, not vibe or fear. And it just breaks my heart that after 12 years of constant mismanagement, 12 years of horrible abuse and rot of our federation, that people still chose Carney. Still chose the Liberals. Still listened to baseless accusations, still believed the media when they said a conservative white mom struggling with two part time jobs and raising four children in Edmonton is racist and that all prairie provinces are bigoted hateful folk. 

Canada isn’t a nation anymore. It’s a collection of echo chambers. Coastal Canada - not just cities - vote like American culture war outposts, hatefully lynching anyone who disagrees. Working class regions get ignored until it’s election season and they get thrown a bone or two. Liberals who have never worked or lived even a week in Sask calling it ugly and boring and full of hillbillies. The conservatives got backlash for wanting to defund the CBC and various media conglomerates - even though media shouldn’t be on the payroll of the current government or any government. 

Poilevre wasn’t perfect. I won’t even say he would’ve fixed our country if he got elected. I won’t say he couldn’t have done more to win. 

But he didn’t lose because he was too extreme. He lost because he wasn’t extreme enough for the times we live in. 

He lost because he did the crime of assuming Canada is still a country and not a bunch of bubbles of red and blue jerseys.

It just breaks my heart. I miss Canada.",https://reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1lypphu/poilievre_lost_because_he_was_too_canadian/,CanadianConservative,0.68,Discussion,False
