r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.



\##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD



Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.



It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread.

> 
> When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
> 
> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies;and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
> 
> He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the dispository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
> 
> For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
> 
> He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country,to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
> 
> In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
> 
> Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
> 
> WE, THEREFORE, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

1l12d9w,"A response to ""Putin didn't invade under Trump""",74,franhd,7,2025-06-01T22:52:25+00:00,"I recently watched a debate between an anti-Trump and pro-Trump panel, where at the end of the discussion, the pro-Trump commentators brought up a common talking point that Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if Trump was president in 2022. Furthermore that Russia only invades when Democrats are in power. I wrote the below in an attempt to dispel this talking point once and for all.

  
\--

Russia was violating ceasefire agreements over and over during Trump's term between 2017 thru 2021. According to the OSCE in their 2020 report, it was over **1.143M** times. This included Russian-backed forces firing rockets at schools, firing upon Ukrainian soldiers, and Ukrainian infrastructure immediately after ceasefire declarations.

\--

Trump has a history of abandoning allies, which further emboldened Russia.

In 2019, Trump **abruptly withdrew** our troops from Syria, essentially throwing the Kurds to the wolves, first to the Turks, and to the Assad regime (backed by Putin), allowing both to fill that power vacuum.

In 2020, Trump bypassed our Afghan allies and **negotiated directly** with the Taliban in Doha, essentially allowing Taliban to up their attacks on the Afghan allies as long as they didn't target US troops on Afghan soil. You can imagine how that went and why it wasn't out of the world for the CIA to suggest the Afghan government would collapse within weeks.

Also in 2020, Trump almost withdrew **12K troops** from Germany (plans frozen by Biden later), citing Germany's failure to increase defense spending. While we could argue about NATO members' failure to up their spending, events like these weren't conducive to our defensive force projection.

In 2019, Trump tried to extort South Korea into paying **400% more** to keep US troops stationed on their soil. It was under Biden that an agreement was reached into just 8% more instead of 400%.

Finally, our favorite event that got Trump impeached - where he withheld **$391M in military aid** to pressure Zelensky into publicly announcing an investigation against Hunter Biden, a political enemy of Trump.

All of these events show history that Trump will put his personal interests ahead of both our country's interests, and those of our allies. He will throw Allies under the bus and over to the wolves whenever convenient.

\--

Russia wasn't **militarily ready** to invade during Trump's term. Not having your strategy, forces, and logistics sorted out has nothing to do with Trump deterring Russia. War planning takes years. Look at China's timeline for invading Taiwan as an example.

You can make another argument that when Trump withdrew our troops from Syria, he allowed full domain for Russia to train their troops and gain XP so they can have numerical and experience advantage over Ukrainian troops.

\--

Trump actively **undermined** NATO during his first term, and was open towards Russia invading NATO members that didn't make efforts to increase military spending.

Again, we can make the argument that NATO members never should have decreased defense spending to favor their voting base and constituents. But openly calling for allowing Russia to invade by blocking members' ability to invoke Article 5 played right into Putin's hands of destabilizing our collective defensive force projection.

In other words, undermining NATO most likely **encouraged** Putin more.

\--

My last point is that Putin heavily would have preferred invading if Trump won the 2020 election.

Biden massively increased support to Ukraine. Trump withheld for **personal gain**.

Biden enacted sanctions against Russia. Trump is looking to negotiate a trade deal instead.

Russia definitely would have had a much weaker international backlash if Trump was president during 2022.

Putin ""fearing"" Trump **holds no water**. Trump weakened NATO resolve, and he weakened our credibility as a super power.

\--

I want to further make a bonus point to answer ""Russia invades during a Democrat's presidency"".

In 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia, that was during Bush's term. Obama was inaugurated in January 2009. If you want to go even further back, Russia intervened in Moldova to create the breakaway state of Transnistria during GHW Bush's term in 1992.

So yes, Russia did invade under Republicans. To state that Russia prefers a political party to invade under is a stupid argument to make. There's nothing to suggest they make decisions based on political parties, only when the opportunity is there. But they definitely would have preferred to invade Ukraine under one man in particular, and we can guess who that man is.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1l12d9w/a_response_to_putin_didnt_invade_under_trump/,Tuesday,0.99,,False

> # JD Vance Responds to Matthew Hennessey on Markets and Politics
> 
> *One needn’t look far in American history for examples of lawmakers wielding the market to the betterment of our people.*

He seems to have taken umbrage at a dual characterization I made of the market in a recent interview. I described it as both an exceptionally efficient way of provisioning goods and services, as well as a tool available to lawmakers as they go about the work of governance. Most important, however, I argued that reducing barriers to free markets shouldn’t be the ultimate aim of our politics. Instead, we should use them, and other tools, to improve the well-being of our people.
> 
> Mr. Hennessey disputes the idea that the market can be operationalized. He describes the market simply—as a sort of universal reality “governed by the laws of economics the way the physical world is governed by the laws of gravity.” It’s an unusually mundane characterization for Mr. Hennessey, whose most recent book, “Visible Hand,” is subtitled “A Wealth of Notions on the Miracle of the Market.”
> 
> It’s also nonsense. One needn’t look far in American history for examples of lawmakers wielding the market to the betterment of our people. President Franklin Roosevelt famously directed the U.S. automotive industry to build the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II. More recently, President Trump has leveraged access to America’s markets for fairer treatment from foreign partners in matters such as trade, illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
> 
> Every day our nation’s lawmakers are faced with choices for how best to improve the lives of our citizens. Many of those entail expanding, managing others’ access to or setting appropriate terms for transacting in our market. These aren’t always easy choices. Should our leaders abandon the interest our nation has in making F-22s and nuclear bombs in America and instead cut costs by offshoring their production? Should we allow enormous volumes of Mexican produce or Chinese autos to decimate productive American industries—or should we use tools like tariffs and trade remedies to protect them? Should policymakers dissolve all medical patents or extend their duration indefinitely?

1kn5qxq,He Wants to Primary Democrats From the Left. No Congress Member Is Safe.,36,therosx,30,2025-05-15T11:24:37+00:00,"David Hogg first rose to prominence as a leader in the March for Our Lives movement. He survived the 2018 Parkland shooting. But these days, politics is his full-time job. And as a Democrat, his main worry is how his party’s brand seems to be in free fall. One poll has put the Democratic Party’s approval rating at just 27 percent.

Hogg is currently vice chair of the Democratic Party. Last month, he announced his plan to fight off what he sees as an existential threat. He says his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, will commit $20 million to funding the candidacies of younger, more progressive congressional candidates—including those looking to unseat safe Democratic incumbents. This was a real throwing down of the gauntlet for a party insider, but it’s something Hogg believes is crucial to fix the problem within the party.

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Hogg about his plans for the Democratic Party, and why politicians should be afraid. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Did you always want to be in politics?

David Hogg: Not necessarily. Honestly, I still wish I didn’t have to be. I’m begrudgingly involved because I feel like I have to in order to accomplish what I feel our generation really needs on gun control, which is not going to come from just sitting on the sidelines and complaining about stuff.

It’s going to come from challenging people in power to do better on all the issues that we’re dealing with. When I was younger, I wanted to be a journalist, and I just wanted to scare the shit out of politicians constantly, and ask them really hard questions. But I realized after the shooting that wasn’t going to be enough for me to get the outcome that I wanted, because I didn’t just want to say what was wrong with our society. I wanted to talk about what we are going to do to actually address it. That hard part is looking at what we are going to do to actually change that corrupt and broken system.

You talk about really putting forward younger candidates, probably more progressive candidates. Is there anyone you would not primary as a Democrat? 

I mean, look, we’re not looking to primary Jamie Raskin, or Rosa DeLauro in Connecticut, for example. These are really prolific progressive fighters. And it’s not as simple as saying, “If you’re above a certain age, you shouldn’t be in office.” Unfortunately, there are young people who suck and there are old people who are great, and vice versa.

So what’s your litmus test? 

It looks different in different districts, and part of what we’re looking at here is trying to make sure that the party knows it’s going to be held accountable to its own values. And frankly, if there’s a member of Congress who has anxiety because they hear this, they should ask themselves why that is.

Is part of your mission scaring certain incumbents into changing philosophically? 

Frankly, the only thing I’ve learned from activism is that the only good politician is a scared politician. They will give you all the lip service that they want. They’ll try to make you feel good and feel like they care. And they probably do care to some extent. But ultimately, what really shows that they care is if they actually change to address the issues of their constituents.

A lot of people compare what you’re doing right now with what happened with the Tea Party. The party rose to prominence in 2008, when Barack Obama had just been elected. The Republican Party was in the wilderness. And then here comes the Tea Party, which over years built a lot of power and morphed. Do you see the Tea Party as an analogue for what you’re doing?

It’s funny you bring that up because I was at a National Finance Committee retreat as part of the Democratic National Convention. They were talking about our approval ratings in the party right now. I said to the data person who was presenting, “What did this graph look like for Republicans before the Tea Party happened?” and they said it looked identical.

My fear is that if we do not show our country—if we don’t show the voters who are Democrats out there—that we’re trying to handle this in a constructive way, we have one of two options here. We can either try to have a constructive place to have these conversations around these primaries in our safer seats to show how our party is doing its own soul-searching in a very healthy and productive way to also hold itself accountable. Or we could do nothing and probably have a wildfire that burns everything down.

It’s a controlled burn. That’s what I’m trying to do here. Because I don’t want it to be extremely destructive in the way that many elements of the Tea Party were. I want our party to use democracy to the fullest extent to make sure that we are holding ourselves accountable and giving voters the option. An important thing to remember here is that the leaders we deserve are not deciding these elections. Ultimately, nobody is entitled to their position of power in this country. Somebody’s seat who’s been there for 20 or 30 years, they might feel like that’s their seat, but it’s not. It’s their constituents’ seat.

This comparison to the Tea Party is apt because it really did take that movement a couple of evolutions and many years to wind up where we are today with a Republican trifecta. Do you see this effort as something that’s like a 15- or 20-year-long push?

I do. I hope that our democracy still exists by that point, to be honest with you. But I do. My long-term goal with Leaders We Deserve has always been to help bring the generation that has gone through school shooter drills and so much gun violence into office.

Former President Joe Biden’s generation didn’t go through school shooter drills, but they did go through nuclear bomb drills. And they went on to pass some of the largest nuclear arms reduction treaties in human history. And part of the reason for that is they understood the anxiety of being told by your government that the best it can do to protect you from a weapon of mass destruction is to teach you how to hide under your desk differently. Whereas for our generation, we’re still going through drills. The difference is that the bomb is going off multiple times a year for us in the form of these school shootings. So in some senses, I would argue it’s even more real.

The beauty of running for office is, unless you’re a Republican, you can’t just talk about what’s wrong. You actually have to talk about what you’re going to do to fix it. And the job of Democrats, it is always going to be harder than Republicans because, unlike them, we don’t run on the idea that government sucks. It is always going to be harder to try to make something work than it is to make it fail. But that is what we do here as Democrats. And what we’re trying to do is bring in that generation that understands the anxiety of the climate crisis, the gun violence epidemic, the student debt crisis, the housing crisis, and so much more. Hopefully, we can lay the groundwork for generations of incredible Democratic leadership to come.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1kn5qxq/he_wants_to_primary_democrats_from_the_left_no/,Tuesday,0.95,Left Wing Bias,False

1kk0y1s,Trump isn’t the only one targeting federal employees. House Republicans are pushing cuts to pension benefits,34,therosx,9,2025-05-11T13:24:06+00:00,"After months of contending with the Trump administration’s multi-pronged effort to downsize the federal workforce, government employees are now facing the possibility of another major change that could push even more of them out the door.

House Republicans are looking to make several big adjustments to federal workers’ retirement benefits to help pay for the party’s sweeping tax and spending cuts package. The House Oversight Committee last week approved a plan that would squeeze $50 billion in savings out of the retirement system over the next decade.

“They’re going to charge people more for the benefit, and then they’re going to reduce the benefit by changing the formula for how the benefit is calculated,” Jacqueline Simon, policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers union, told reporters on Monday.

The cuts could lead workers eligible for retirement to head for the exits in an effort to lock in their current benefits, union leaders say.

Congressional Republicans have long wanted to overhaul federal staffers’ pension system, as did President Donald Trump during his first term. But their efforts typically did not advance far.

In the current political environment, however, the policy push may have a greater chance of succeeding.

Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” has not yet been finalized and must still be approved by the full House and the Senate.

Rep. James Comer, the committee’s chair, described the effort as a way to save Americans money.

“The simple truth is that a significant amount of the costs associated with all of these benefits are funded by hardworking taxpayers in the private sector and increasingly now federal government borrowing,” Comer said in his opening remarks when the committee examined the plan.

At least one House Republican has already come out against the measure. Ohio Rep. Mike Turner joined Democrats in voting against the committee’s plan last week.

“I oppose any and all efforts to reduce federal spending by taking money from the hard-earned pensions of federal workers,” he said in a statement. “These pensions are not giveaways – they are promises to federal workers in exchange for their dedicated service.”

**Hiking the contribution rate**

The most significant measure approved by the committee would raise the Federal Employees Retirement System contribution rate for many current civilian and postal employees to 4.4% of their salary. Those hired prior to 2014 generally contribute either 0.8% or 3.1%, while more recent hires typically already contribute 4.4%.

For new retirees who are too young to collect Social Security benefits, the plan would eliminate an additional payment that’s currently available to retired federal workers until they turn 62.

The plan would also base retirees’ pension payments on their average highest five earning years, instead of highest three years, which could reduce benefits by thousands of dollars annually.

Certain employees, including those in law enforcement, Customs and Border Protection officers and air traffic controllers, would not be subject to these provisions, though they would not be eligible for the additional pension payment until after their mandatory retirement age of 56 or 57, depending on their position.

Plus, the plan would impose an additional 5% pension contribution for new employees who don’t agree to serve “at will,” a status that would give them fewer job protections.

The proposed plan has sparked a fresh round of concerns among federal workers, particularly among older employees, union leaders say.

“People are very frustrated at the moment, thinking that it’s kind of like a bait and switch,” said Brandy Moore White, president of the AFGE’s Council of Prison Locals, which represents more than 30,000 correctional officers and staff at federal prisons.

Although her members are not subject to many of the provisions, those who retire before they turn 57 would not receive supplemental payments until they hit that mandatory retirement age. The loss would be “devastating” for a share of the prison workforce since it’s not uncommon for employees to retire in their 40s or early 50s after years of service.

At the Social Security Administration, a quarter of the staff are eligible for retirement, said Jessica LaPointe, president of AFGE’s Council 220, which represents workers in the agency’s centers, field offices and other units. Some are calling her to say they want to put in their retirement papers now so they can lock in their pension benefits.

“There’s no way that I would be able to absorb that hit,” she said her colleagues are telling her.

Peer-reviewed research is slow and time-consuming. Sharing lurid stories of vaccine injuries is easy. 

>Today, Bret Weinstein’s conspiracy theories span multiple domains. Documented by Chris Kavanagh, of the Decoding the Gurus podcast, and Jesse Singal, independent journalist and Dispatch contributor, Weinstein has suggested that Israel’s unpreparedness for the October 7 attack was deliberately orchestrated by powerful interests to create division among COVID skeptics; China’s one-child policy was strategically designed to create an army of males to infiltrate the U.S. military; and that his own groundbreaking telomere research was stolen by one of his peers—who went on to win a Nobel Prize.

1k7wlsf,FBI arrests Milwaukee-area judge for obstruction in immigration case,49,therosx,52,2025-04-25T21:36:24+00:00,"The FBI arrested a Milwaukee County judge on Friday for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest, a remarkable escalation of the administration’s battle with the judiciary.

“Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on charges of obstruction — after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,” Patel announced on X on Friday morning before deleting the post. He later reposted an identical version of it.

https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1915800907318468626

Dugan was arrested on charges of obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, according to a criminal complaint filed Thursday. It was not immediately clear why Patel deleted his initial post.
Dugan is a Milwaukee County circuit court judge, an elected position. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported earlier this week that the FBI was investigating her, and she told the paper via email that “nearly every fact regarding the ‘tips’ in your email is inaccurate.”

During a hearing for Dugan’s case on Friday, her attorney, Craig Mastantuono, said “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety.” And some Democrats strongly condemned the move that threatened the government’s separation of powers.

But the Trump administration touted the FBI’s actions. “The days of actively aiding and abetting illegal aliens invading our country are over,” White House spokesperson Kush DeSai said in a statement to POLITICO on the arrest. “The Trump administration will never waver on putting Americans and America First with a no-nonsense approach to immigration enforcement. In this administration, anyone who commits crimes exposes themselves to criminal liability.”

Flores-Ruiz was in the country unlawfully, after being deported in 2013, according to the affidavit. He was scheduled to attend a hearing on April 18 for battery-domestic abuse charges when an ICE task force arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse with an administrative warrant to arrest him.

Dugan was on the bench leading an unrelated proceeding when she was notified of ICE’s presence in the building by a public defender, the complaint alleged. Federal officials assert that she then left the courtroom and told the agents they needed a different warrant and had to speak with Chief Judge Carl Ashley, before allegedly helping sneak Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out of the courtroom through a door leading to a private hallway.

Authorities ultimately arrested Flores-Ruiz after what was described as a foot chase outside of the courthouse.

“We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest,” Patel wrote in his social media post. Patel said the judge’s actions “created increased danger to the public.”

The Trump administration has pledged to investigate and potentially prosecute local officials who refuse to cooperate with the administration’s sweeping deportation agenda. A Department of Justice memo sent in January told federal prosecutors to pursue charges when necessary.

And in February, Trump signed an executive order directing agency heads to ensure federal funding wasn’t facilitating illegal immigration or “sanctuary policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

Trump administration officials celebrated the charges on Friday. Attorney General Pam Bondi shared a warning to officials who assist undocumented immigrants with avoiding arrest during a Friday appearance on Fox News: “We’re going to prosecute you and we are prosecuting you.”

During Trump’s first presidency, the Justice Department indicted a local Massachusetts judge on charges of obstructing federal immigration authorities. The charges were later dropped after the judge agreed to refer herself to the Massachusetts Commission on Judicial Conduct for possible discipline.

Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers criticized the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on judges — without directly defending Dugan — in a public statement released on Friday about the arrest.

“I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law,” he said.

And Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) called the Trump administration’s arrest of Dugan a “gravely serious and drastic move” that “threatens to breach” the government’s separations of power on Friday.

“Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by,” Baldwin said in a statement posted to X. “By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders and arresting a sitting judge, this president is putting those basic democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line.”

The presiding judge ordered Dugan released on her own recognizance on Friday. The government did not request a bond. Her next court appearance is May 15.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1k7wlsf/fbi_arrests_milwaukeearea_judge_for_obstruction/,Tuesday,0.96,,False

1jyhexn,Trump administration overrode Social Security staff to list immigrants as dead,82,therosx,12,2025-04-13T20:37:41+00:00,"Two days after the Social Security Administration purposely and falsely labeled 6,100 living immigrants as dead, security guards arrived at the office of a well-regarded senior executive in the agency’s Woodlawn, Maryland, headquarters.

Greg Pearre, who oversaw a staff of hundreds of technology experts, had pushed back on the Trump administration’s plan to move the migrants’ names into a Social Security death database, eliminating their ability to legally earn wages and, officials hoped, spurring them to leave the country. In particular, Pearre had clashed with Scott Coulter, the new chief information officer installed by Elon Musk. Pearre told Coulter that the plan was illegal, cruel and risked declaring the wrong people dead, according to three people familiar with the events.

But his objections did not go over well with Trump political appointees. And so on Thursday, the security guards in Pearre’s office told him it was time to leave.

They walked Pearre out of the building, capping a momentous internal battle over the novel strategy — pushed by Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service and the Department of Homeland Security — to add thousands of immigrants ranging in age from teenagers to octogenarians to the agency’s Death Master File. The dataset is used by government agencies, employers, banks and landlords to check the status of employees, residents, clients and others.

The episode also followed earlier warnings from senior Social Security officials that the database was insecure and could be easily edited without proof of death — a vulnerability, staffers say, that the Trump administration has now exploited.

The warnings and Pearre’s removal have not previously been reported. This account of how the Trump administration pushed Social Security to wrongly declare thousands of living immigrants dead is based on interviews with 15 people, including current and former Social Security officials, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, as well as more than two dozen pages of records obtained by The Washington Post.

Experts in government, consumer rights and immigration law said the administration’s action is illegal. Labeling people dead strips them of the privacy protections granted to living individuals — and knowingly classifying living people as dead counts as falsifying government records, they said. This is in addition to the harm inflicted on those suddenly declared dead, who become unable to legally earn a living wage or draw benefits they may be eligible for. Social Security itself has acknowledged that an incorrect death declaration is a “devastating” blow.

“This is an unprecedented step,” said Devin O’Connor, a senior fellow on the federal fiscal policy team for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank. “The administration seems to basically be saying they have the right to essentially declare people equivalent to dead who have not died. That’s a hard concept to believe, but it brings enormous risks and consequences.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, by adding the immigrant names to the deaths database, “the Trump Administration is protecting lawful American citizens and their hard-earned Social Security benefits, and ensuring illegal immigrants will no longer receive such economic entitlements. Anyone who disagrees with the common sense policies of this Administration can find a new job.”

Officials at Social Security, which has gutted its press office after months of turmoil over declining services, did not respond to requests for comment.

Coulter, an investment firm founder named to the top technology job on March 27, hung up on a reporter from The Post on Friday.

Pearre declined to comment. He joined Social Security right out of college, rising from an entry-level IT job to a senior executive position overseeing the agency’s sprawling databases. After his removal from his office this past week, he was placed on paid leave, possibly severing his 25-year career.

‘You literally become financially paralyzed’

Staffers at Social Security began raising the alarm about the urgent need to address a flaw in the agency’s deaths database in February, according to a person familiar with the matter and records obtained by The Post.

Anybody granted the appropriate permissions within Social Security could mark someone as dead, employees had realized, without having to prove their demise in any way — for example by referencing medical records or a death certificate. In emails and meetings that rose up the management chain, employees warned that the dataset was vulnerable to manipulation, according to the person and the records.

Employees’ fear was partly that a bad actor who gained access to government credentials could label groups of living individuals as dead to target them for punishment, according to the person and the records. Some of those raising the alarm worried specifically that the Trump administration might try to use the database to go after people the president dislikes, the person said.
Management indicated they were looking into the matter and exploring a proposed solution that would have required some additional proof of death before placing them into the Death Master File, according to the person and the records.
But no solution was enacted.

Entry into the Death Master File has potentially severe consequences, effectively erasing a person’s ability to live and draw wages in the United States, according to Jim Francis, a consumer law attorney. Francis — who recently sued Social Security for mistakenly labeling a Maryland woman dead — noted that the agency sells its death information to creditors, pension companies, life insurers and credit reporting firms.

“It’s the source of that data that the whole world uses, which is why, if it’s inaccurate, it has such devastating impacts on people,” Francis said. “Overnight you literally become financially paralyzed.”

Tom Kind, a 90-year-old retiree who lives in Denver, recently experienced the “nightmare” himself when he was wrongly added to the deaths database without his knowledge. He lost his health-care coverage and Social Security benefits and struggled to navigate a bureaucratic maze, learning he needed to prove he was still alive to the agency by completing an in-person interview at a field office.

“That’s not any fun,” he said.
Around the same time Social Security staff were warning that the agency’s powerful ability to declare deaths could be exploited, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. DOGE Service arrived at the agency. Soon, representatives of both groups were hunting for ways to repurpose the agency’s databases to identify and deport illegal immigrants.

A staff of fewer than a dozen career employees was assigned to work with Musk’s team on the project, according to a senior official who left the agency around that time. Career employees were concerned that they might be facilitating something illegal, asking themselves if they were at risk of going to jail for the work they were doing, the official said.

By March, DOGE’s focus on immigration issues was clear, according to two people with knowledge of the team’s activities. DOGE representatives were asking a lot of questions about which kinds of address, wage and tax data they could access, and how that information could be used to determine citizenship status, the people said.

One official chose to resign rather than remain involved in what he saw as an illegal attempt to repurpose the agency for immigration enforcement.

Homeland Security, meanwhile, at first made less intrusive requests, according to the senior official and records obtained by The Post. DHS agents spent much of February and March trawling through years of records in E-Verify, the Homeland Security employment verification program, to identify potentially fraudulent Social Security numbers, according to the records. Agents then reached out to Social Security asking for help preventing this type of fraud, the records show.

Homeland Security also requested that Social Security staff turn over the addresses of undocumented immigrants so Immigration and Customs Enforcement could track them down for deportation, the former senior official said.

It was not the first time that Trump officials sought to make Social Security hand over some of the government’s most sensitive personally identifiable information to facilitate deportations. During Trump’s first term, a White House aide requested the names and Social Security numbers of employers thought to have hired undocumented immigrants, the former official said.
At the time, the general counsel’s office at Social Security said no. They had determined such a search would be a fishing expedition, the former official said, and would break the law — so the issue was dropped.

A shift in administration demands

No such resistance emerged this time.

In recent weeks, Homeland Security’s requests shifted, according to the former senior Social Security official. Immigration agents began meeting with DOGE representatives at the agency to discuss how they could achieve their larger goal of pushing out tens of thousands of migrants that ICE was struggling to apprehend and deport, the official said.

That request soon morphed into the idea of placing immigrants into the deaths database, the official said.

Leland Dudek — the acting commissioner who was elevated from a low-level position after displaying public loyalty to DOGE — had qualms about the task, according to two people with knowledge of his thinking. He thought it was illegal, the people said.

Then Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem intervened — and Dudek agreed to move forward.
On Monday, according to four people familiar with the matter, Dudek signed two memorandums with Noem allowing the database action. Dudek declined to comment on the episode.

The next day, 6,100 mostly Hispanic names and their attached Social Security numbers were added to the Death Master File, according to records reviewed by The Post.

The White House told The Post that the roughly 6,000 immigrants all have links to either terrorist activity or criminal records. The official did not provide evidence of the alleged crimes or terrorist ties but said some are included on an FBI terror watch list.

The immigrants added to the death database include a 13-year-old, a 14-year-old and two 16-year-olds — as well as one person in their 80s and a handful in their 70s, according to records obtained by The Post.

Some agency staff have since checked the names and Social Security numbers of some the youngest immigrants against data the agency typically uses to search for criminal history and found no evidence of crimes or law enforcement interactions, staffers said.

Among the people targeted were immigrants with valid Social Security numbers who had lost legal status, such as those who participated in Biden-era work programs that ended under the new administration, according to a White House official.

Within Social Security, the general counsel’s office is preparing an opinion that will find the Trump administration’s unprecedented use of the death database a violation of privacy law, according to one person with knowledge of the upcoming declaration. The opinion will take issue with the agency knowingly and falsely declaring that living people are dead, the person said.

On Friday, a group of unions and an advocacy organization suing the Social Security Administration argued in a new court filing that the agency had violated a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE from the agency’s systems with personally identifiable information by adding names to the deaths database.

Meanwhile, the effort to move immigrants who are alive into the deaths database is proceeding. On Thursday, Social Security added 102 names, records show.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1jyhexn/trump_administration_overrode_social_security/,Tuesday,0.98,,False

1jvi4nt,"Kash Patel was removed as acting ATF director, U.S. officials confirm",38,therosx,12,2025-04-09T22:03:40+00:00,"FBI Director Kash Patel was removed from his role as acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and replaced by Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll, U.S. officials confirmed on Wednesday.

Reuters was first to report the leadership change, which the U.S. Justice Department had not disclosed publicly. As of Wednesday afternoon, Patel's photo and title of acting director was still listed on the ATF's website.

Patel was sworn in as acting ATF leader on February 24, three days after he was sworn in as FBI director, a role he continues to hold. It was unusual for one person to be tapped to lead to major Justice Department units at the same time.

A Justice Department official confirmed Patel's removal and said it had nothing to do with his job performance. The official did not say why Patel was removed.

U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll is now serving as acting ATF director, the Justice Department official said. Three other sources familiar with the decision said Driscoll will continue to hold both roles.

It is unclear when Patel was formally removed from his post or when Driscoll was notified of his new responsibility. Driscoll was traveling on Wednesday, and was in the Middle East earlier this week.

President Donald Trump's second term has featured multiple whipsaw policy reversals, including the firing and rehiring of large numbers of federal workers and on Wednesday the temporary lowering of tariffs on many countries, less than 24 hours after steep new taxes on imports kicked in.

Senior Justice Department officials are currently weighing whether to merge the ATF with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as part of an effort to cut costs.

GUN RIGHTS FOCUS

Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has made protecting gun rights a key part of her agenda, has launched a task force to focus on enforcing the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms, according to a memo seen by Reuters.

She said the ATF would serve on the task force along with representatives from other parts of the Justice Department, including the Civil Rights Division.

Trump previously ordered the department to review a slew of firearms regulations implemented during Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.

The ATF earlier this week formally repealed its so-called ""zero tolerance policy"" which called for revoking the licenses of gun dealers who willfully committed serious violations, such as failing to conduct background checks.

The Monday press release included a quote from Patel as acting director.
It is unclear how the leadership change at ATF could affect the way it regulates the firearms industry, or why Driscoll was tapped to lead it.
The NSSF, the industry's leading trade association, in a statement on Wednesday said the decision to name Driscoll was ""indicative of his resolve to bring reform to ATF and protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.""

Patel's initial appointment as acting ATF director shocked career insiders at the department.

When Patel was sworn in as FBI director on February 21, he posed for a photograph with the White House's counterterrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka.

Gorka then posted the photo on his X account with a since-deleted message which read: ""Oh, by the way, meet the new Director of the ATF. Yes. Seriously.""

No one at the ATF knew about Trump's plans to install Patel, five current and former ATF officials familiar with the matter said at the time.

On the day of his swearing in, Patel spent about an hour at ATF headquarters where he urged staff to focus on arresting violent gang members, two of those officials told Reuters.

He had not been a presence at headquarters since, according to four current and former officials.
The leadership vacuum at the agency tasked with investigating firearm, bomb and arson-related crimes has worried current and former law enforcement officials who say its weakened state could impede efforts to protect public safety and make it more vulnerable to regulatory cuts that could hinder its ability to investigate violent gun-wielding criminals.

""To see them in the situation they're in now is just really heartbreaking,"" said Peter Forcelli, a former ATF assistant director who spent much of his career investigating gangs and other criminal organizations.

""The fact they're getting kicked around like a soccer ball is to me just incredibly disrespectful.""

> 
> In the days after Japan surrendered at the end of World War II, he was a young boy living in a small town. As American troops moved to occupy the country, the mood was one of panicked terror. The Japanese had been told by their leaders that the victorious Americans would murder, rape and pillage just as their own troops had treated their defeated enemies—though of course the Japanese people didn’t know that.
> 
> Eventually American trucks rolled through the town and he and his family cowered indoors, awaiting the inevitable savagery. They watched as GIs jumped down from their vehicles and began placing heavy boxes on the street. At first they assumed the boxes contained some terrible weapon—poison gas perhaps, or booby-trapped bombs—but when the troops were gone and the boxes remained, some of the more curious and braver kids ventured out and began opening them. Inside were layers and layers of chocolate bars, candy, and other treats the near-starving Japanese had not seen in years.
> 
> The memory lived with him his whole life, and the story moved me greatly, as I have traveled across the world and become a proud American myself. It is one small vignette of how the U.S. has used not only the power of its economic and military strength to advance its interests but the awesome force of its values, the example of its commitment to human dignity, freedom and justice. As a picture of soft power it is all the more vivid because it came just weeks after the U.S. had undertaken the most terrifying demonstration of hard power in history, incinerating tens of thousands of those same Japanese whose children were now being saved by the American military.
> 
> Getting this balance between hard and soft power right was probably the greatest achievement of American leadership in the long peace that followed that war. I worry that in our brave new world of American strategy we are on the way to destroying it.
> 
> America’s reputation, built on its ideals and burnished over centuries, is the greatest geopolitical brand ever created. But as someone put it to me this past week, we may be witnessing the greatest exercise in brand destruction in history. Brands have real value. It isn’t always easy to calculate, but businesses from BlackBerry to Bud Light know when they have lost it. Destroying geopolitical brand value can be devastating too.
> 
> President Trump isn’t wrong when he complains that the world has taken advantage of America and its mostly benign leadership for too long. Japan is a case in point: sheltering under a U.S. security umbrella even as it pursued protectionist trade policies. But redressing that injustice requires not only robust new policies. It requires a targeted and subtle diplomacy.
> 
> Allies—staunchly pro-American friends from Canada to Denmark to Poland—are sullen, angry and scared. Adversaries who have long envied our power and tried unsuccessfully to undermine it, are hugging themselves with joy.
> 
> The import tariffs announced last week are a good example. I am not convinced about the economic transformation claimed for them, but I will readily acknowledge that decades of relative industrial decline and hefty trade deficits have had their costs. There is also no doubt that some countries have discriminatory trade practices against the U.S. that should be redressed.
> 
> But that’s not what Mr. Trump did last week. Tariffs on Switzerland, a country that has, in effect, no import duties? Singapore? What are we doing punishing Korea and Japan with duties based on a calculation that isn’t based on tariffs or other barriers to trade? Add to that the duties on those hapless penguins of the Australian territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and we look not only mean but stupid.
> 
> The same goes for foreign policy. Again Mr. Trump has the right instincts: Allies have been cosseted for too long in the comfort blanket of American guarantees. But what exactly do we gain by punishing Ukraine? What are we doing threatening to annex Greenland?
> 
> This behavior damages more than our moral standing in the world. It is actively counterproductive. Greenland won’t surrender to us. We will eventually do some sort of deal, almost certainly worse than the one we could have negotiated without the threats, and alienate an ally and friend in the process.
> 
> The Trump administration is implementing domestic policies in the same unnecessarily damaging way. The president has a mandate to rid the country of out-of-control illegal immigration. The process was never going to look pretty, but doing it in ways that contradict American values (and break the law) offsets part of the benefit.
> 
> Mr. Trump may find all this in-your-face diplomacy satisfying now. But casting off America’s reputation as a place that reveres freedom, dignity and the rule of law will harm the brand—and not just in the long term.

1juched,"Defending Trump Policies in Court Leads to Criticism, Doubt and Punishment",36,therosx,11,2025-04-08T12:35:38+00:00,"
The Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to enact major elements of its agenda have led to a series of courtroom clashes between increasingly skeptical judges and the beleaguered lawyers responsible for defending the government’s positions, which some have come to see as indefensible.

The Justice Department’s thinned-out civil division has borne the brunt of the growing conflict. Inside the division, the strains of pushing the legal limits on topics as varied as mass deportations, spending power and punishing law firms are taking a major toll. Government litigators, their ranks increasingly depleted, often find themselves in court with few facts to defend policies they cannot explain, according to current and former officials.

Career lawyers representing the government have a long tradition of arguing for the goals of Republican or Democratic administrations, regardless of their personal views. What is different now, they say, is that they increasingly feel trapped between President Trump’s partisan political appointees, who insist on a maximalist approach, and judges who demand comprehensible answers to basic questions.

The most prominent example of this squeeze came on Saturday when one of the department’s senior immigration lawyers, Erez Reuveni, was suspended indefinitely after speaking candidly about the administration’s mistaken deportation of a Maryland man to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador.

https://archive.ph/o/hJokJ/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/justice-dept-immigration-lawyer-leave.html

A day earlier, Mr. Reuveni appeared in a federal courtroom in Maryland, where, under pressure from a judge, he alternated between exasperation and concern, conceding that the deportation last month of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia should never have happened. 

He asked for 24 hours to persuade his client, the Trump administration, to begin efforts to return Mr. Abrego Garcia to the United States.

“Good clients listen to their lawyers,” the judge, Paula Xinis, said.
Instead, the client punished its lawyer. In a letter on Saturday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said Mr. Reuveni had failed to follow orders and instead committed “conduct prejudicial to your client.”

A second senior immigration lawyer involved in the Abrego Garcia case, August Flentje, was also placed on administrative leave for his failure “to supervise a subordinate,” according to two officials familiar with the move.

“Justice Department attorneys are being put in an impossible position: Obey the president, or uphold their ethical duty to the court and the Constitution,” said Stacey Young, a former department lawyer who is now the executive director of Justice Connection, an organization of former department officials.

The loss of the two immigration lawyers in the middle of the litigation hits a division that had already been shadowed by retirements and transfers. Thus far, Mr. Trump’s political hires have proved more adept at firing those officials than hiring to make up for the losses, though the pace of recruiting at conservative law schools has been increasing, according to officials.
Yet Mr. Reuveni was hardly a member of a liberal resistance. 

He had litigated dozens of cases for administrations under both parties. He worked on a crucial part of the Trump agenda, going after localities that sheltered undocumented immigrants — which helped earn him a recent promotion and praise.
In several other high-profile cases, career prosecutors were punished for refusing to take actions they deemed unprofessional, improper or unethical, most notably the resignation and suspensions of federal prosecutors who refused to dismiss the case against Mayor Eric Adams of New York.

The exodus has forced three top Trump-appointed staff members — Mr. Blanche, his top aide Emil Bove III and Chad Mizelle, the department’s chief of staff — to sign motions or make court appearances that typically would have been handled by career officials.

While dismaying to Justice Department veterans, the actions were in keeping with a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi that lawyers must not deviate from the decisions made by their superiors. She went so far as to release a statement saying the suspension was a message to anyone who prioritized decisions of conscience over her orders.

The practice of strong-arming career officials who question the legal or ethical basis of directives from the Trump team comes directly from Mr. Trump and his top advisers, who see the department, created as an independent arbiter of impartial justice, as an executor of their political will.

Even before Ms. Bondi took over in February, Trump appointees — led by a former member of his criminal defense team — presided over a wave of forced transfers, demotions and dismissals in the department’s criminal division.

Those tactics have now spread to the civil division, which is straining under the weight of defending dozens of lawsuits filed against Mr. Trump’s rapid-fire executive actions.

Current and former Justice Department litigators say they have never seen anything like it.

“I think the velocity and ferocity of the work is just unprecedented, in the number and kinds of cases and the speed with which they have been challenged,” said Jennifer Ricketts, who retired as the head of the Justice Department’s federal programs branch last year. Despite the blistering pace of litigation, Ms. Ricketts added that at her former office, the staff of lawyers had shrunk from roughly 100 to about half that number.

In rushing to govern by decree, the president has sought to punish law firms that once employed prosecutors who targeted him; end or limit other practices he dislikes at those firms, like providing free legal representation to immigrants seeking asylum in the United States; deport as many undocumented immigrants as possible; fire tens of thousands of federal workers; and slash the federal budget, which was once a congressional prerogative.

One immediate consequence is that many of those moves are being challenged in court, leading to dozens of emergency hearings around the country.

At times, the lawyers representing the Trump administration seem to have little understanding of what the White House is doing, or why.

During a recent hearing over an executive order seeking to bar the law firm Jenner & Block from engaging with the federal government, Judge John Bates of Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., pressed a government lawyer, Richard Lawson, to explain why the White House considered the firm a national security threat.

The concern, Mr. Lawson argued, was that a lawyer who left Jenner & Block years earlier, Andrew Weissmann, had been a longtime deputy to Robert S. Mueller III, who as the special counsel investigated Mr. Trump’s possible ties to Russia.

“But he’s a former employee,” the judge said. “You’re not really going to tell me that having someone employed four years ago poses some kind of national security threat?”

After a pregnant pause, Mr. Lawson answered, “not per se, no,” prompting laughter from some in the courtroom. Questioned further by the judge, Mr. Lawson changed course, declaring that “the national security interests are not critical.”

There were other oddities to the hearing. A recent hire to the department, he had previously worked for Ms. Bondi in Florida on consumer protection issues. And as he rushed from one courtroom to another for two emergency hearings concerning Mr. Trump’s bid to undercut the work of law firms, he sat alone, with no career lawyer by his side to assist.

To Judge Bates, who once worked in the local U.S. attorney’s office as a chief of civil litigation, the entire approach was jarring.
“The Department of Justice has a lot of lawyers,” he asked. “Why is this all on you, Mr. Lawson?”

Straightening his glasses, he replied that none of his colleagues were available. “I, frankly, was supposed to be in Florida, but here I am,” Mr. Lawson said.

“I don’t find that much of an answer,” the judge replied. Shortly after, he ruled against the Trump administration.

Despite the significant victory the Supreme Court handed to the White House last week in upholding the administration’s plan to cut off teacher training grants, federal judges have, in many cases, expressed a growing sense of disbelief to some of the administration’s answers.

Judge James E. Boasberg of Federal District Court in Washington, who is considering whether the administration violated his explicit orders to stop deportation flights to El Salvador invoked under a wartime statute, suggested Friday that he may hold contempt hearings. 

The move, he indicated, may be necessary given how little the government has been willing to tell him about the flights themselves.
When a lawyer for the Justice Department, Drew Ensign, said the government had complied with the orders, the judge pushed back sharply.

“If you really believed everything you did that day was legal and could survive a court challenge, I can’t believe you ever would have operated in the way you did,” Judge Boasberg said.

The judge then suggested the administration had intentionally acted so that it could ship Venezuelan deportees to a prison in a third country “before it was possible to challenge it legally.”
Mr. Ensign said, “I don’t have any information on that.”

Some judges have expressed anger with the answers they are getting.
Last week, Judge Edward M. Chen of Federal District Court for the Northern District of California called it “disingenuous” for the Department of Homeland Security to claim that ending a temporary protected status for over 350,000 Venezuelans would not lead to deportations.

In late March, Judge Amy Berman Jackson was even more pointed as she considered the government’s plans to shut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The administration, she wrote, “was so disingenuous that the court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything.”

1jtnbi7,U.S. sent 238 migrants to Salvadoran mega-prison; documents indicate most have no apparent criminal records,66,therosx,21,2025-04-07T14:59:32+00:00,"Three weeks ago, 238 Venezuelan migrants were flown from Texas to a maximum security prison in El Salvador.

That country's president offered to take them and the Trump administration used a law not invoked since World War II to send them -- claiming they are all terrorists and violent gang members.

The government has released very little information about the men. But through internal government documents, we have obtained a list of their identities and found that an overwhelming majority have no apparent criminal convictions or even criminal charges. 

They are now prisoners. 

Among them: a makeup artist, a soccer player and a food delivery driver, being held in a place so harsh that El Salvador's justice minister once said the only way out is in a coffin.

The shackled men were forced to lower their heads and bodies as they were unloaded from buses and taken to El Salvador's mega prison, known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

Andry Hernandez Romero was among them.

Lindsay Toczylowski: Andry is a 31-year-old Venezuelan. He's a makeup artist. He is a gay man. He loves to do theatre. He was part of a theatre troupe in his hometown. 

Lindsay Toczylowski, Andry's attorney, says he does not have a criminal record in the United States or Venezuela. She says he left his home country last year because he was targeted for being gay and for his political views. 

Last May, Andry made the long trek north through the Darien Gap to Mexico, where he eventually got an appointment to seek asylum in the United States. At a legal border crossing near San Diego, he was taken into custody while his case was processed.

Cecilia Vega: Did he have a strong asylum case?

Lindsay Toczylowski: We believe he did have a strong asylum case. He had also done a credible fear interview, which is the very first part of seeking asylum in the United States. And the government had found that his threats against him were credible, and that he had a real probability of winning an asylum claim. 

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/photojournalist-witnesses-venezuelan-migrants-arrival-in-el-salvador-60-minutes/

But last month Andry did not appear for a court hearing. 

Lindsay Toczylowski: Our client, who was in the middle of seeking asylum, just disappeared. One day he was there, and the next day we're supposed to have court, and he wasn't brought to court.

Cecilia Vega: You use the word ""disappeared.""

Lindsay Toczylowski: Yeah, I use that word because that's what happened.

But Andry did appear in photos taken by Time magazine photographer Philip Holsinger, who was there when the Venezuelans arrived at CECOT. 

Holsinger told us he heard a young man say: ""I'm not a gang member. I'm gay. I'm a stylist."" And that he cried for his mother as he was slapped and had his head shaved.

By comparing Holsinger's photographs to photos of Andry's tattoos taken by the government, we were able to confirm that this is Andry. His lawyer, who is representing him pro bono, had never seen these photos before.

Lindsay Toczylowski: It's horrifying to see someone who we've met and know as a sweet, funny artist, in the most horrible conditions I could imagine.

Cecilia Vega: You fear for Andry's safety in there?

Lindsay Toczylowski: Absolutely. We have grave concerns about whether he can survive. 

In October, Tom Homan, who is now the White House border czar, told 60 Minutes the Trump administration's mass deportation plan would start by removing the worst of the worst.

Tom Homan: We're gonna prioritize those with convictions. We're gonna prioritize national security threats. We have to do that. You gotta get the worst first.

But are they the worst? The Trump administration has yet to release the identities of the Venezuelan men it sent to El Salvador last month. We obtained internal government documents listing their names and any known criminal information. We cross referenced that with domestic and international court filings, news reports and arrest records whenever we could find them.

At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. 

For 3% of those deported, it is unclear whether a criminal record exists. 

But we could not find criminal records for 75% of the Venezuelans - 179 men- now sitting in prison.

In response to our findings, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said many of those without criminal records, quote ""are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters, and more. They just don't have a rap sheet in the u.s.""

Border Czar Tom Homan said immigration agents spent hours conducting rigorous checks on each of the men to confirm they are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang president Trump campaigned on eradicating.

Donald Trump: To expedite removals of the Tren de Aragua savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil

But in Andry's case, the only evidence the government presented in immigration court were these pictures of his tattoos, crowns, which immigration authorities say can be a symbol of Tren de Aragua 

Lindsay Toczylowski: These are tattoos that not only have a plausible explanation because he is someone who worked in the beauty pageant industry. But also the crowns themself were on top of the names of his parents. The most plausible explanation for that are that his mom and dad are his king and queen.

Cecilia Vega: Could it be possible that there is something that perhaps the government knows that you don't?

Lindsay Toczylowski: I don't think that that is possible. But if it was possible that they had some information, they should follow the Constitution, present that information, give us the ability to reply to it. 

A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said on social media that its intelligence assessments ""go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos."" She said Andry's ""own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua."" We went back a decade and could only find photos like these.

Tattoos and social media were also used to link another Venezuelan migrant— Jerce Reyes Barrios — to the Tren de Aragua gang. Immigration court documents include this Facebook post from 14 years ago showing him flashing what officers said was a gang sign.

His girlfriend told us it was all about rock n' roll. 

Immigration agents also flagged Jerce's crown tattoo as a gang symbol. But they did not mention the crown is above a soccer ball. Jerce was a soccer player in Venezuela. His lawyer says the tattoo honors his favorite team, Real Madrid, whose logo includes a crown. 

Organized crime analysts told us members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang can often be identified by signature tattoos. But Tren de Aragua is different.

Cecilia Vega: Are tattoos a reliable indicator of membership in Tren de Aragua? 

Lee Gelernt: No. Expert after expert tells us tattoos are not a reliable indicator of whether you're part of this particular gang. 

Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, is leading the legal challenge against the Trump administration's efforts to send migrants to CECOT.

Cecilia Vega: There are a lot of people who might hear what you're saying and say, ""These people don't have papers. They should be deported."" To that, you say what?

Lee Gelernt: If they are here illegally and don't have a right to stay, they can be deported back to their home country. If they've committed crimes, they can be prosecuted and perhaps spend many, many years in a U.S. prison. It's not a matter of, ""Can these individuals be punished?"" It's a matter of how the government is gonna go about doing it. Once we start using wartime authority with no oversight, anything is possible. Anybody can be picked up.

Last month, President Trump did what he had promised on the campaign trail. He invoked a 1798 law called the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to remove non-citizens without immigration hearings during times of war or invasion.

Lee Gelernt: Every administration back to 1798 has understood this is wartime authority to be used when the United States is at war with a foreign government. The administration is saying, ""Not only are we gonna use it against a criminal organization, but you the courts have no role. You cannot tell us that we're violating the law or stop us."" 

Cecilia Vega: Does the U.S. even have the legal right to send someone who's been deported from its country to a foreign prison?

Lee Gelernt: The United States does not have that right. You know, I wanna go back to World War II, the last time that any president used this authority. We sent people back to their home country. We didn't send them to a foreign prison. Even during World War II, Germans had the right to contest their designation under the Alien Enemies Act. As one of the judges pointed out in the Appeals Court, Nazis had more process than we're giving to these Venezuelan men.

Before the three planes arrived in El Salvador, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to turn them around. Flight tracking data shows two planes were in the air at the time and one was about to take off from Texas. Instead of turning around, all the planes made a stop at a military base in Honduras. And then, despite Judge Boasberg's verbal and written orders, the planes all flew to El Salvador.

Since then, the U.S. government has disclosed very few details about the operation. CBS News published the only list of all 238 deportees. 

Lee Gelernt: The government is refusing to answer almost every question from the court.

Cecilia Vega: Based on what grounds?

Lee Gelernt: Well, now they've invoked what's called the State Secrets Privilege. They are saying they can't even confirm details about the planes.

We asked a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman what evidence the government has – besides tattoos and social media posts – linking people like Andry and Jerce to Tren de Aragua. She cited ""state secrets"" and ""ongoing litigation"" as the reasons ""DHS cannot comment on these individual allegations.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited CECOT last month, declined our request for an interview. At the prison she recorded this video. She was standing in front of a cell packed with Salvadoran gang members - not Venezuelans.

Kristi Noem: Know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.

The Trump administration is paying El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's government $6 million to house prisoners it sends to CECOT. Lawyers and family members of the Venezuelans told us they've had no contact with the men since they arrived.

Cecilia Vega: Do you have any idea how long he might be there?

Alirio Antonio Fuenmayor (in Spanish/English translation): We have no idea.

Alirio Antonio Fuenmayor's younger brother, Alirio Guillermo, was picked up by immigration agents while working as a food delivery driver in Utah. Though he had no criminal record, he was sent to El Salvador last month.

Alirio Antonio Fuenmayor (in Spanish/English translation): He is an innocent person, he has not committed any crime, and he's in a maximum-security prison.

The ACLU's Lee Gelernt has spent decades challenging immigration policies of democratic and republican administrations. But on the fate of the Venezuelan men… 

Cecilia Vega: What would you say to these families who are terrified right now about their relatives currently sitting in this prison in El Salvador? Will they ever see them again?

Lee Gelernt: I hope so, but, you know, there's a real danger that they remain there.

Cecilia Vega: You're saying that there are Venezuelans who very well may have no gang ties that are right now in one of the hardest of hardcore prisons in the world that may never get out, they may never see the light of day again.

1jsu73t,‘Hands Off!’ protesters across US rally against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk,74,therosx,18,2025-04-06T13:32:13+00:00," 
Millions of people took part in protests against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk across all 50 states and globally on Saturday, organized by a pro-democracy movement in response to what they call a “hostile takeover” and attack on American rights and freedoms.

Over 1,400 “Hands Off!” mass-action protests were held at state capitols, federal buildings, congressional offices, Social Security’s headquarters, parks and city halls throughout the entire country – anywhere “we can make sure they hear us,” organizers said. “Hands Off!” demands “an end to this billionaire power grab.”

“Whether you are mobilized by the attacks on our democracy, the slashing of jobs, the invasion of privacy, or the assault on our services – this moment is for you,” the event flyers state. “We are setting out to build a massive, visible, national rejection of this crisis.”

Nearly 600,000 people had signed up to attend the events, some of which took place in major cities like London and Paris, according to Indivisible, one of the organizations leading the movement in collaboration with a nationwide coalition that includes civil rights organizations, veterans, women’s rights groups, labor unions and LGBTQ+ advocates.

Organizers say they have three demands: “an end to the billionaire takeover and rampant corruption of the Trump administration; an end to slashing federal funds for Medicaid, Social Security, and other programs working people rely on; and an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.”

CNN has reached out to the White House for a statement.

State representatives speak at protests
During the Hands Off! protest in Washington, DC, multiple representatives took to the podium to speak about the Trump administration, including Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who said there is no future with a president who has “the politics of Mussolini and the economics of Herbert Hoover.”

“Our founders wrote a Constitution that does not begin with ‘We the dictators,’ the preamble says ‘We the people,’” Raskin said in front of a crowd of thousands gathered at the Washington Monument, holding signs condemning the administration. “No moral person wants an economy-crashing dictator who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.”

Rallygoers traveled from across the country in a show of force at the nation’s capital over concerns of the administration’s policies. Demonstrators on the National Mall chanted, “Hey ho, Trump’s gotta go,” while holding signs reading “Protect our Constitution” and “Hands off our rights.”

﻿“If you want a country that still believes in due process, we have to fight for it,” said Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar at the Washington protest. “If you believe in a country where we take care of our neighbors, look after the poor and make sure our children have a future they can believe in, we have to fight for it.”

Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost also spoke, urging people to take action by protesting, donating to mutual aid, participating in direction action and focusing on legislative strategies.

﻿“Throughout human history, authoritarians, they’re never satisfied with the power they have, and so they test the bounds, they push the limits, they break the law, and then they look at the public to see if they’re quiet or if they’re loud,” said Frost

In Los Angeles, protesters marched along a 1-mile loop toward City Hall, chanting “Power to the People” and wielding signs with messages like “Hands Off Education” and “Resist, Resist.”

Since Trump took office, his administration has been vocal about its efforts to cut federal spending, regardless of who it may harm. Thousands of federal workers have been laid off or issued immediate termination notifications as part of Trump and Musk’s plan to downsize the federal government.

And Musk, the world’s richest man, has aggressively pushed policies to reduce spending as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, all while repeatedly misleading the public about federal spending.

He has also boasted that he put USAID — an agency that feeds some of the world’s poorest, most desperate people and has saved millions of lives — “in the wood chipper.”

They dismantled foreign aid programs that support fragile democracies abroad and put on leave federal workers who protect US elections at home in a move that current and former officials say abandons decades of American commitments to democracy.

The Social Security Administration, responsible for monthly benefits to around 73 million Americans, is now in turmoil after a massive reorganization, including cutting thousands of employees.

Trump and his team have also taken extraordinary measures to crack down on immigration, aggressively pressuring ICE to pick up the pace of migrant arrests and touting mass deportation plans despite the administration making multiple missteps in recent weeks, including mistakenly deporting a Salvadoran man.

“They tell us that immigrants are stealing our jobs, but they’re the ones shipping jobs overseas and hiring corporate lawyers to go and union bust,” said Frost.

“They tell us that trans people are a threat to our children, but they’re the ones dismantling public education. They’re the ones denying the climate crisis. They’re the ones poisoning our planet. They’re the ones doing nothing about the national public health emergency of gun violence,” Frost added.

The Trump administration has frequently questioned climate science and said it will roll back major climate policies, including rules that target pollution from vehicles and power plants, in a major blow to America’s progress on clean air, clean water and climate action. Trump has also ordered the federal government to re-evaluate its gun policies and all ongoing litigation that could restrict Americans’ gun rights.

Frost called the current state of politics in America an “insidious rise of authoritarianism” fueled by “corrupt billionaires and mega corporations” who think they have a right to control all aspects of the lives of their citizens, including freedom of speech.

The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian refugee﻿ whose green card was revoked over his involvement in demonstrations at Columbia University, has raised chilling questions about whether people can truly exercise their constitutionally protected right to free speech.

“Our communities are paying the price while the Trumps and Musks of the world cash in. It’s not just about money – it’s about power,” Hands Off! organizers wrote. “This administration is targeting everybody who isn’t part of the 1% – veterans, kids, seniors, farmers, immigrants, transgender people, and political opponents. All to consolidate power and reward their allies.”

Although protests across the country were largely peaceful, in downtown Lafayette, Indiana, a man took a long gun out of his car and approached the crowd.

Lafayette Police say the man attempted to make a lawful turn at an intersection near the Tippecanoe County Courthouse but was blocked by protesters in the street. The man got out of his truck and, according to the police statement, was headbutted by a protester after tensions escalated between him and the crowd of demonstrators.

The man then returned to the truck and got a gun from his vehicle, which he later described as an act of self-defense, before placing it back in his truck, the statement reads.

Lafayette police officers detained the man after receiving reports that he had pointed the weapon at protesters. However, police said that after investigating the incident, they determined he had not aimed the firearm at anyone and released him.

Labor union presidents speak out
Two federal employee union presidents spoke out on Saturday against Trump and his policies targeting federal workers at the protest in DC.

“(The) Trump administration is absolutely destroying public services in this country. That’s right. They claim to be making government more efficient,” said National Federation of Federal Employees President Randy Erwin. “That is a joke, people. That is a cruel joke. They’re doing the exact opposite.”

NFFE and the American Federation of Government Employees are a part of a coalition of unions that filed a lawsuit in the US District Court in San Francisco this week seeking to stop the Trump administration from ending collective bargaining rights for many federal employees.

“They thought we were easy targets. But let me tell you something about union members and veterans. We will not be intimidated. I’m a veteran myself. I’m an Army veteran. We will not be silenced. We will not bow down. We’ll stand up and say hands off our union. We’ll stand up and say hands off our contract,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said.

Erwin called the move by the Trump administration “the biggest assault on collective bargaining that we have ever seen in this country.”

“AFGE has been in the courts, in the media, in Congress, and here with you on the street. And not only are we in the court, but we are kicking their behind while we’re in the court, and we’re going to continue to kick their behind,” Kelley said.

Since taking office, Trump has sought to reshape the federal workforce. In one of his earliest moves, he ended remote work for government employees and agencies were provided guidance on how they can override union collective bargaining agreements on telework and remote work.

At least 121,361 workers have been fired from federal agencies so far, as of CNN’s latest tally on March 28.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1jsu73t/hands_off_protesters_across_us_rally_against/,Tuesday,0.89,,False

1jow9vw,Kennedy lays off thousands across the health bureaucracy,51,therosx,12,2025-04-01T13:59:52+00:00,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is making good on his promise to lay off thousands of employees across the government’s health care agencies.

Overnight, employees of the Department of Health and Human Services lost their jobs as part of a reduction in force that aims to cut 10,000 of the department’s approximately 80,000 workers. The cuts hit staff across the panoply of HHS agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health.

Those let go included senior civil service leaders, as well as workers handling everything from communications to worker safety to HIV prevention.
“This RIF action does not reflect directly on your service, performance, or conduct,” emails to the affected employees said.

The early-morning “reduction in force” comes after days of worry for the workers, many of whom were told to expect notices on Friday or over the weekend. The move was delayed in part due to tensions between the Elon Musk-led push to downsize the federal government and leadership at HHS that has felt left out of the decision-making.

The cuts are part of a much broader push, led by Musk, to make the government more efficient. Kennedy has embraced the push, promising in the run-up to his February confirmation as HHS secretary to make “corrupt” FDA workers he sees as too cozy with the pharmaceutical industry “pack your bags.” The agency regulates drugs, food and medical devices.

He also pledged hundreds of job cuts at the NIH, the largest funder of medical research in the world, with a budget of $48 billion.

On Tuesday morning, people showed up for work only to find their key cards didn’t work.

“I woke up at 5 a.m., heard my friends got the email so I went to the building to clear out my personal stuff before they shut down my building access,” said one laid off CDC employee. “I grabbed my diplomas off the wall and my favorite plants … just so demoralizing.”

Among those cut at the FDA was Peter Stein, director of the Office of New Drugs. The policy office inside of OND was also eliminated.

Another top FDA regulator, Brian King, the director of the agency’s Center for Tobacco Products, was placed on administrative leave, according to an email sent to his staff and obtained by POLITICO. He’s sought to curtail youth use of e-cigarettes.

“I encourage you to hold your heads high and never compromise the guiding tenets that CTP has held dear since its inception,” King wrote in the email to his staff. “We obeyed the law. We followed the science. We told the truth.”

Nearly every press officer at the FDA was let go, one agency employee said. The more-than-a-dozen workers affected fielded media inquiries related to the agency’s vast regulatory portfolio.

Also axed was the FDA’s Office of Strategic Programs, including its director, Sridhar Mantha. He co-chaired the AI Council at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The council helped develop policy around AI’s use in drug development and assisted the FDA in using AI internally.

A number of divisions at the CDC were hit with layoffs, said two employees granted anonymity for fear of retribution.

Those divisions include the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention; the Global Health Center; National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities; and the National Center for Environmental Health.

An HHS letter to a labor union representing HHS workers said the cuts also hit the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the division of the CDC focused on worker safety. The letter said about 185 employees would be let go in just the Morgantown, West Virginia, location.

According to a notice sent to NIOSH employees, the reduction in force will take effect on June 30.

HHS did not immediately respond to questions about how many employees would be affected at other NIOSH offices, but CBS News reported yesterday that the total could be as high as 873, around two-thirds of the workforce.

NIOSH is slated to be part of the new agency that Kennedy plans to create – the Administration for a Healthy America.

1jo32eu,The Great Grovel: How Trump forced elite institutions to bend to his will,46,therosx,8,2025-03-31T13:22:35+00:00,"One after another, a parade of the wealthiest and most elite institutions in American life since last November have found themselves confronted by unprecedented demands from President Donald Trump and his team of retribution-seekers.

One after another, these establishment pillars have met these demands with the same response: capitulation and compliance.

The details are varied but two themes are consistent. The first is an effort — far more organized and disciplined than any precedent from Trump’s first term — to bring institutions who have earned the president’s ire to heel. The second theme is even more surprising: The swiftness with which supposedly powerful and supposedly independent institutions have responded — with something akin to the trembling acquiescence of a child surrendering his lunch money to a big kid on the morning walk to school.

Cumulatively, the cases represent an astonishing new chapter in the history of the American establishment: The Great Grovel.

Prestigious law firms have cowered at his threats to tank their business; Paul, Weiss, which fought against Trump in his first term, pledged $40 million in pro bono legal services to issues Trump has supported. And Skadden Arps, one of the largest law firms in the world, reached a deal with Trump to provide $100 million in free legal work to administration-friendly causes — before Trump had taken any action against them.

One of the country’s most storied news networks, ABC News, settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump for $15 million that will go to his future presidential library, and another, CBS News, appears poised to settle for millions more. The Washington Post and the LA Times, both legacy papers owned by Trump-friendly billionaires, have adjusted the content of their editorial pages in ways that pleased the White House. And Columbia University, alma mater to Alexander Hamilton, agreed to nine policy changes in an effort to unfreeze $400 million in federal funding. Other universities hired Republican lobbyists to stay on the president’s good side.

A team of POLITICO reporters in recent days set out to illuminate the common threads between these diverse episodes. They interviewed key figures at institutions who have been targeted, as well as people in and around Trump’s circle. Here are four conclusions:

A transactional age

Leaders of the institutions who have complied with Trump’s demands do not accept the White House’s idea that the basic premises of American governance have changed, and a New Normal has arrived. Quite the contrary, what people are yearning for is a return to the Old Normal, in which familiar revenue lines and profit margins stay intact.

When Brad Karp, chair of Paul, Weiss sent a firm-wide letter on March 23 justifying his decision to make a deal with Trump, he emphasized “the need to ensure, above all, that our firm would survive.”

Trump’s executive order, which mirrors ones he has issued about firms WilmerHale, Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block, stripped attorneys of security clearances and restricted their ability to do federal work. It was, in Karp’s own words, an “existential” threat to the firm. But there is deep concern among firm alumni that their former boss’s decision to make a deal with Trump will pave the way for other concessions to the administration. Last week, more than 100 alumni sent a letter to Karp calling the deal a “permanent stain on the face of a great firm that sought to gain a profit by forfeiting its soul.”

Former attorneys at Paul, Weiss granted anonymity to speak candidly about the firm say Karp’s decision also reflects a shift in power and strategic focus over the last eight years. Paul, Weiss’s corporate practice has greatly expanded since the days of the first Trump administration. In 2017, when the firm was sending partners to work 12 hour shifts at airports as part of their response to Trump’s Muslim travel ban, revenue was just over $1 billion. Last year, the firm reported more than $2 billion in revenue, according to Law.com.

“You bring people together on the corporate side, you’re not intent on fighting,” one person said. “Whereas on the litigation side you have to be a fighter.”

Meanwhile Skadden’s executive partner Jeremy London shared details of his negotiation in a firm-wide email sent Friday and obtained by POLITICO. He had learned the Trump administration intended to issue an executive order aimed at the firm. “We chose to engage proactively and constructively with the Administration to align on a productive path forward without the issuance of an executive order,” he wrote. “We entered into the agreement the President announced today because, when faced with the alternatives, it became clear that it was the best path to protect our clients, our people and our Firm.”

The firms seem to have made a calculated decision that going along with Trump’s demands would, like some sort of rubber-gloved procedure at the doctor’s office, be unpleasant for a moment but would lead swiftly to business as usual.

There have been exceptions: Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, Big Law firms targeted by Trump with similar punishment, have opted to fight him in court.

But even Trump is surprised by the scale of the capitulation: “They’re all bending and saying, ‘Sir, thank you very much,’” Trump said, speaking at a White House event for Women’s History Month Wednesday. “Nobody can believe it, including law firms that have been so horrible… and they’re just saying, where do I sign?”

Pressure points

Trump’s actions have illuminated more vividly than ever just how many wealthy private institutions have their finances and policies enmeshed with the federal government — though it is hardly a new phenomenon. What is different is the willingness of Trump and his lieutenants to use this leverage so unabashedly. Along the way, he has revealed the institutions to be more vulnerable to intimidation than their leaders themselves may have recognized.

Earlier this month Columbia moved to comply with nine demands by the Trump administration in order to potentially unfreeze $400 million in U.S. federal research funding — a major blow to the school, which relies on about $1.3 billion in government grants each year to support its $6.3 billion annual operating budget. The university, which has changed its policies to better support Jewish students after pro-Palestinian protests rocked the campus last year, had already considered many of the changes, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. Those included rules that would compel masked protesters to reveal their identities, and deputizing campus public safety officers to make arrests.

“We have been advancing our work to address discrimination and harassment for months in a variety of ways, including engagement with government agencies to address ongoing concerns,” a Columbia spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO.

But leaders at the university also knew “lifesaving research” would be “seriously curtailed” without the $400 million in research funding, the person said. Taking the actions, the Trump administration made clear, would be the only path toward getting it back.

The dynamics at work in the Great Grovel reveal a paradox. In theory, wealthy institutions with more diverse revenue lines should be more insulated from outside pressure. In practice, the opposite seems true, since these wealthy interests perceive more points of vulnerability — and, from the other perspective, potential profit — they therefore have more incentive to get along and go along.

The decision to settle the libel case was deeply unpopular at ABC News, where many journalists thought an independent news entity needed to defend itself vigorously. But ABC is only a small part of the Walt Disney Corp., where executives apparently decided defending the suit risked embarrassment because of the legal discovery process and could harm the larger business. “It sent a chilling message to the newsroom that they could be sold out by the higher ups and by the corporate division” at Disney, said a person who works with Disney granted anonymity to speak candidly. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment.

Likewise, it is hard to imagine an earlier generation of Washington Post publishers contributing $1 million to a president’s inaugural fund. But that is what Post owner Jeff Bezos did for Trump. And Amazon, the company he founded and where he remains a key shareholder, reportedly signed a $40 million deal with Melania Trump to distribute a documentary about her, along with other content projects.

The imbalance of power

Much of the credit for Trump’s new sense of ideological purpose in the second term has focused on top advisors like Stephen Miller or budget director Russ Vought. Both have played roles in the administration’s effort to use executive branch leverage against institutions outside the government. But the retribution campaign is much more of a team effort, involving Trump allies across agencies and even outside advisors.

“Retribution is an important component of justice,” said Mike Davis, a Trump ally who runs an outside judicial advocacy group. “It restores the victims and serves as a powerful deterrent.”

Davis is one of a handful of outside Trump advisers developing strategies to go after the president’s political enemies. The push against the law firms is driven from the outside by longtime Trump aides Boris Epshteyn and Jason Miller, though Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has also been involved, two people familiar with the conversations, granted anonymity to discuss details of them, said. On the inside, Stephen Miller plays a role.

While Trump enjoys a wide array of support, his targets typically have found themselves alone and isolated.

“There’s a giant collective action problem because everybody’s looking out for number one,” said the person who works with Disney.

There has been no effective effort so far by universities to work in concert to halt Trump’s actions at Columbia or other campuses. Kicking the Associated Press out of the White House pool prompted howls by other reporters, but most news organizations basically kept on with their ordinary business. Major law firms haven’t released a joint statement condemning Trump’s moves against their industry colleagues.

“If law firms and businesses and others within the private sector choose not to stand up and front a resistance to this power that [Trump] is claiming, but which the Constitution does not give him, then he will have that power,” said Mary Spooner, who worked at Paul, Weiss for more than a decade. “But it becomes much, much harder to resist when individual organizations and institutions and corporations are forced to resist alone.”

Humiliation is the point

Trump’s campaign against institutions has some ideological origins—grounded in antipathy to what critics see as illegitimate government subsidies or the alleged “wokeness” of their internal practices on such matters as diversity, equity and inclusion.

On equal footing with these motivations, however, is a psychological dimension.

Trump targeted law firms that employed attorneys who have investigated him or fought him in court. He’s going after media organizations for perceived partisan bias or anti-Trump sentiment. His grudge against Columbia dates back to the 1990s, when he had attempted to sell the school property on the Upper West Side for upward of $400 million, the New York Times reported, and walked out of a meeting with trustees when they offered significantly less. Then, last spring, Columbia became the center of a global student protest movement of pro-Palestinian encampments — and an elite, urban, progressive school for Republicans to turn into an example.

According to people near the negotiations, Trump and his supporters care as much or more about public rituals of self-abasement— as in the ABC and law firm settlements — as they do about the substantive details of the original disputes.

In the eyes of critics, Trump has for a lifetime caressed his grievances as if he were supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld stroking his cat. “What you see here is a group of people who think they missed an opportunity the first time around — that they didn’t fully realize what they now believe to be the powers of the presidency and they didn’t maximize Trump’s indiscriminate, narcissistic, vengeful nature,” said Ty Cobb, a former White House lawyer during the first Trump administration. “They’re playing to Trump’s strengths, which is as a mob boss.”

It is far from clear from the reporting, however, that Trump’s team would regard this as an insult. To the contrary, people in his orbit are pleased that the whole world can now see what they already knew: In Trump’s four years out of power, he and his allies were thinking hard about what they would use their power for if they got it back.

1jmxl2w,Trump Warned U.S. Automakers Not to Raise Prices in Response to Tariffs,69,therosx,37,2025-03-29T22:08:32+00:00,"When President Trump convened CEOs of some of the country’s top automakers for a call earlier this month, he issued a warning: They better not raise car prices because of tariffs.

Trump told the executives that the White House would look unfavorably on such a move, leaving some of them rattled and worried they would face punishment if they increased prices, people with knowledge of the call said. 

Instead, Trump said, they should be grateful for his elimination of what he called President Joe Biden’s electric-vehicle mandate, which involved subsidies and emissions requirements to encourage electric-car production. He made a lengthy pitch for how they would actually benefit from tariffs, two people on the call said, adding that he was bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and was better for their industry than previous presidents. 

The tariffs would be “great,” Trump said, according to one of the people.
On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and parts starting April 2, a move almost certain to force American carmakers to raise prices on customers.   Most automakers depend on parts and materials from other countries to make cars, including vehicles assembled in the U.S. 

“You’re going to see prices going down, but going to go down specifically because they’re going to buy what we’re doing, incentivizing companies to—and even countries—companies to come into America,” he said at the event. 

Trump’s relationship with automakers since taking office has been a rocky one, illustrating one of the challenges so far to his economic orthodoxy. The president is trying to curb inflation—voters’ cost-of-living concerns helped fuel his 2024 victory and are now one of his top vulnerabilities, experts say—while imposing tariffs on industries such as auto manufacturing that he says will remake the U.S. trade order. 

Detroit’s automakers and industry suppliers in particular have made clear there is little they can do but raise prices in the face of tariffs. Bringing more factories back to the U. S.—a tenet of Trump’s tariff strategy—can take years for car companies to make happen. 

“Tariffs, at any level, cannot be offset or absorbed,” Ray Scott, chief executive of parts supplier Lear, wrote in an email Tuesday to employees that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. “A holistic, industrywide approach will be necessary to mitigate the impact.” 
For now, dealers have stockpiled a two- to three-month supply of new cars, meaning the impact of the tariffs might not start to be felt until May. 

At that point, vehicle prices could rise 11% to 12% to offset the tariffs, Morgan Stanley analysts said Thursday in a note. 

It is unclear what the Trump administration could do if automakers raise their prices. Trump has targeted disfavored law firms with executive orders, and automakers rely on federal regulators for critical approvals.

Inside the Trump administration, inflation has been a concern among Trump’s economic team, even if he rarely addresses it publicly, according to three people familiar with the matter.

“It is difficult to see how imposed tariffs over time would not have some impact on prices,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents General Motors, Jeep-parent Stellantis and Ford. 

Kush Desai, a Trump spokesman, said “restoring Main Street, re-establishing American manufacturing dominance and putting the American people first are the only interests guiding President Trump’s decisions.”  The existence of the call between Trump and the auto CEOs was earlier reported by the New York Times. 

Concerns about rising prices have been a constant refrain from other executives who have met with Trump as they try to dissuade him from major tariffs. Oil-and-gas executives from the American Petroleum Institute have argued that tariffs could cause the price of gasoline to go up, particularly in the Midwest. Gasoline prices have dropped slightly since Trump took office, according to AAA.

People familiar with Trump’s thinking say he is likely to impose few, if any, tariffs on the energy sector, in large part because of those concerns. 
Food companies also have argued that prices would go up on products Americans love if his tariffs go forward, White House officials say. 

“Trump is obviously very fond of tariffs, but the American public dislikes higher prices as the 2024 election results clearly demonstrated,” said Clark Packard, a tariff expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. 
For several weeks, major car companies to mom-and-pop suppliers across the industry have been working feverishly to prepare for any fallout of Trump’s new tariffs. 

An executive at one of the automakers said they were baffled by the desire to both impose tariffs—but also tell car companies they couldn’t raise prices. 

“The math would tell you, that’s going to cost us multibillions of dollars,” the executive said. “So who pays for that?” 

Automakers have signaled to their retailers the enormous pressure they were under. Stellantis earlier this month said the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico favor Asian and European rivals and sent U.S. dealers an email with talking points to share with lawmakers.

“We encourage you to contact your federal and state representatives to share your opinion on a matter that threatens to disrupt our business,” read the email, which was viewed by the Journal.

1jjlwt0,House GOP will hear from Wall Street deficit hawk as lawmakers struggle over tax cut costs,60,therosx,9,2025-03-25T15:22:38+00:00,"Ray Dalio, a billionaire investor who repeatedly has warned about America’s unsustainable debt trajectory, will brief House Republicans on Tuesday morning, at the invitation of Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas).

His appearance comes as Republicans struggle with how to account for the cost of their tax cut plans, with some pushing for an accounting strategy that would zero-out the price tag and others warning that would amount to fiscal fraud.

Just in recent weeks, Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has said that America’s debt situation could cause an “economic heart attack” and “shocking developments.”

“It is imperative that members of Congress engage with thought leaders like Mr. Dalio, who have extensive, real-world experience that can help guide us as we work to restore fiscal sanity in Washington before it’s too late,” Arrington said ahead of the briefing.

Dalio’s appearance, planned for after the House GOP conference meeting, comes as congressional Republicans are still hashing out some of the big-picture questions on a huge budget package this year, including how much a potential plan might add to deficits.

One particularly large outstanding question is whether Republicans should use a current policy baseline, which would assert that there is no cost to extending the temporary parts of the 2017 Trump tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of this year.

It’s not clear whether the Senate parliamentarian will allow such an approach in a budget reconciliation measure, which is how Republicans plan to pass their agenda. But it would give the GOP more headroom than the traditional current law baseline, which would hold that keeping the expiring provisions would cost $4 trillion or more over a decade.

The budget resolution that passed the House last month uses the current law approach.

Some House deficit hawks haven’t held back in knocking the current policy baseline — and just within recent days, a CBO analysis requested by Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) found that the federal debt would soar if the tax provisions were extended without being offset.

1jhxz82,McCarthy: Trump has ‘broken the Democratic party’,51,therosx,70,2025-03-23T12:18:33+00:00,"Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Saturday that President Trump has “broken the Democratic Party,” adding that it has become “leaderless” and party members are “fighting among themselves.”

“It is a huge mess,” McCarthy said of the present state of the Democratic Party in a conversation with radio host John Catsimatidis on “The Cats Roundtable” Sunday on WABC 770 AM. “It wasn’t just that President Trump won the election. He has now broken the Democratic Party,” he said.

“If you think about it, they are leaderless. There’s no message, and their polling continues to drop. They are now fighting among themselves,” he continued.

McCarthy added that House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are displaying “weak leadership.”

The former speaker went on to say that Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who recently addressed a joint rally in Las Vegas, are currently leading the party.
“The real leaders of the Democratic Party right now are AOC and Bernie Sanders. Those are the two that are getting the crowds,” he said.

In response to a question about Schumer supporting the stopgap bill that averted a government shutdown earlier this month, McCarthy said, “But his own party attacked him for it.”

“I mean what you are finding out here is the House is without a leader. What has Hakeem Jeffries done? He has no messaging. He can’t make a decision. You got AOC leading the Democratic Party now,” McCarthy said.

“I don’t know how much longer Hakeem Jeffries and Schumer can stay leaders. They’re in hiding,” he said, adding, “Their own party is working against them.”

The California Republican further said that the Democratic Party’s leadership challenges show how strong Trump is. “His polling is getting stronger, because he secured the borders. That’s what he said he would do.”

McCarthy also slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), calling him a “chameleon” and accusing him of now “talking like a Republican” and featuring a slew of Republicans on his new podcast “This Is Gavin Newsom.”

“Gavin is the biggest chameleon who ever lived,” McCarthy said.

1jh632y,Reagan Republicans Didn’t Disappear. They Were Just Demoted.,67,therosx,26,2025-03-22T11:09:40+00:00,"Over the last decade, it’s become commonplace to describe President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party as hostile — as if the one-time New York real estate mogul was the political version of a corporate raider. That’s a gross mischaracterization, one that has contributed to a misunderstanding of the source of Trump’s hypnotic influence over the GOP.

Trump managed to upend the party because, long before he announced his first bid for president in June 2015, there was a robust faction of conservative populists inside the GOP yearning for a figure just like him. Populists who preferred a street fighter to a statesman; a domestic industrialist to a free trader; a quasi-isolationist to an internationalist. All they needed was a champion who could also appeal to enough Republican voters to win a presidential primary.

Trump’s takeover rebalanced power within the Republican governing coalition. The populists, long the junior partner, rose to take command, and the Ronald Reagan Republicans, for years the controlling bloc, found themselves demoted. Even after all this time, they find it disconcerting.

“I feel a bit politically homeless at times,” Republican operative Mike DuHaime told me. DuHaime runs a public relations firm in New Jersey and is a longtime adviser to Chris Christie, the Republican former Garden State governor who challenged Trump for the 2024 nomination. He concedes never voting for Trump but emphasized his continued support for the party down-ticket. His biggest gripe with the GOP’s new (populist) establishment?

“I never agreed with the party on everything, but there was some tolerance of differences of opinion from leaders in the party. Not so much anymore,” DuHaime said. “I find myself agreeing with Trump on some stuff and disagreeing on others. But there’s a purity test now. It’s sad to see so many people twist themselves into pretzels to comply with whatever Trump says.”

Kevin Madden, who spent years in Republican politics, first as a congressional aide and later as an adviser to 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said feeling the party transform beneath his feet has been “humbling.”

“When you spend years working as a staffer in Congress, and then years working on political campaigns, it’s a seven-days-a-week, 18-hours-a-day lifestyle. That amount of time and devotion can lead you to convince yourself that you know everything about the party,” explained Madden, now a government relations executive in Washington, DC. “The party shift since 2006 to where it is today has been an education.”

There’s a misperception, especially among MAGA activists, that center-right opposition to the president equals “Never Trump.” But in dozens of conversations I had with Republican primary voters in 2024 on the campaign trail for The Dispatch, and in regular discussions I have about Trump and the state of the party with GOP operatives, I’ve discovered more nuanced views of the president.

After 10 years of Trump dominating American politics, everyone is familiar with the aspects of the president’s personal comportment and policy agenda that can cause some Republicans heartburn. Who knows; Trump’s expansive use of tariffs and belligerent treatment of American allies overseas may yet reopen fissures with elements of the center-right that bedeviled the president in his first term and helped sink his 2020 reelection bid.

But there’s also plenty about Trump that Reagan Republicans like: tax cuts, deregulation, military spending and support for Israel, to name a few, not to mention his decision to let technology titan Elon Musk take a hatchet to the federal bureaucracy. And even when their public scolding of Trump makes them outcasts in their own party, they don’t feel any more welcome in the Democratic Party, which they believe veered too far to the left — culturally, economically and on some foreign policy matters — to even consider jumping ship.

“While I love Liz Cheney and her courage, saying she was ‘proud’ to vote for Harris was dissonant to anti-Trump Republicans. What those Republicans would have identified with was that she hated that she had to vote for Harris,” said Rob Stutzman, a Republican operative in Sacramento, recalling how Cheney, a former Wyoming congresswoman who disowned Trump after the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol, talked about her support for Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

Indeed, if Democrats are wondering how Trump won over Republicans who shunned him during his first term and in 2020, they need to look in the mirror, many Republicans, both voters and party insiders, have told me. This anecdote from Stutzman, the rare Republican vocal about his opposition to Trump, was instructive: “When I was working with No Labels in hopes of recruiting a third [presidential] candidate, we would see in focus groups that GOP voters who didn’t like Trump were pushed to him by Biden. Biden, and then Harris, consolidated Republicans into Trump.”

“There is no doubt to me that the Democratic party of the past decade completely fertilized the ground that allowed Trump to grow,” Stutzman added. “I blame them.”

Neither Trump’s populist supporters nor the president’s displaced conservative skeptics are convinced the GOP’s current power dynamic is irrevocably locked in place. “It’s been a long fight; it continues every day,” Steven Bannon, a prominent Trump supporter — whose daily podcast, War Room, is ground zero for the president’s MAGA movement — told me during a recent telephone conversation. “I tell people: Don’t think we’ve ever won.”

Tim Chapman, veteran conservative activist and adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate in 2016 and 2020, is engaged in that fight, hoping to contribute to a restoration of the Reagan wing of the GOP. “There’s a weakness to the national conservative populist position, which is that they really don’t have yet [ideological buy-in] across the board, but they have the power,” he told me late last week.

“The question is: Can they hold onto the power long enough to change rank and file voters’ opinions on what it means to be a conservative?”",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1jh632y/reagan_republicans_didnt_disappear_they_were_just/,Tuesday,0.88,,False

1jg2lk4,These are the federal judges Republicans aim to impeach,63,therosx,25,2025-03-20T23:12:46+00:00,"House Republicans are targeting a growing cohort of federal judges with impeachment for issuing rulings unfavorable to the Trump administration.

Why it matters: It's a stark break with tradition as judges until now have been impeached mainly for gross personal misconduct, financial corruption or other serious criminal offenses.
Trump has fueled the effort by advocating judicial impeachments, though some GOP lawmakers have expressed pause.

U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts also pushed back Tuesday, saying in a rare statement: ""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.""
""The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,"" Roberts said.

By the numbers: House Republicans have introduced or threatened articles of impeachment against more than a half-dozen federal district court judges who ruled against Trump.
House Republican leaders have not ruled out holding impeachment votes, but with a two-seat majority and some Republicans uncomfortable with the idea, they could be a heavy lift.

To actually remove any of these judges, all Senate Republicans and at least 14 Democrats would have to vote to convict them — likely an impossible threshold.
James Boasberg — Chief Judge, District of Columbia

Boasberg incurred Trump's wrath by ordering a plane deporting roughly 250 alleged Venezuelan gang members turned around as he adjudicated the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1789.

Trump said Tuesday in a post on Truth Social: ""This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!""

Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) quickly introduced articles of impeachment the same day accusing Boasberg of abuse of power, backed by five Republican co-sponsors.

Paul Engelmayer — Southern District of New York

Engelmayer issued a ruling last month blocking DOGE from accessing Department of Treasury records with sensitive personal data.

Reps. Derrick Van Orden (R-Ariz.) and Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) have both introduced articles of impeachment against Engelmayer. Crane's measure has seven GOP co-sponsors.

John Bates — District of Columbia

Bates ordered the Trump administration to restore health agency websites that were shut down by an executive order cracking down on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).

Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) introduced articles of impeachment against Bates last month homing in on ""socially divisive and destructive LGBTQI+ content"" on the sites.

Ogles accused Bates of ""conduct so utterly lacking in intellectual honesty and basic integrity that he is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Amir Ali — District of Columbia

Ali ruled that Trump lacks ""unbounded power"" to curtail foreign aid that has been appropriated by congress, ordering the administration to restart frozen aid payments.

Ogles introduced articles of impeachment against Ali last month calling his ruling ""arbitrary and capricious"" and, as with Bates, accusing him of ""lacking in intellectual honesty and basic integrity.""

John J. McConnell Jr. — District of Rhode Island

McConnell blocked an Office of Management and Budget order in January temporarily freezing all federal grant, loan and financial assistance programs.

Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) said last month he plans to introduce articles of impeachment against McConnell.

Adam Abelson — District of Maryland

Abelson issued an order last month blocking Trump's executive order to end all federal funding for programs promoting DEI.

Crane, in a post on X, floated impeaching Abselson, with Trump confidante Elon Musk also expressing his support for the idea.

1jey8fk,"Chuck Schumer clung to belief Republicans would ‘expel’ Trump, book says",60,therosx,36,2025-03-19T14:26:31+00:00,"Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, insisted Republicans would move on from Donald Trump and go back to a past version of the party even as Trump’s return to power loomed last year, according to the authors of a new book on politics during the Biden administration.

The revelation comes as Trump’s second term has begin in a flurry of radical policy moves that have rocked the US’s political landscape and triggered fears of a slide into authoritarianism. It also comes amid serious Democratic backlash against Schumer for failing to provide stiff enough resistance to Trump’s actions.

Schumer told Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater: “Here’s my hope … after this election, when the Republican party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican party.”

That insult may cause a splash at the White House in light of Trump’s abuse of Schumer, who he said last week was “not Jewish any more”, over the senator’s response to anti-Israel college protests.

According to Karni and Broadwater, of the New York Times, Schumer delivered his judgment over a glass of wine one night in June 2023. With hindsight, the authors add: “If Schumer had seen any of it coming, he had not wanted to face it.”

They are referring to events since Trump’s win over Joe Biden in November, including the appointment of extremists to key roles and Trump’s assault on the federal government, assisted by Elon Musk.

“The old Republican party was leaving, and the new MAGA guard was staying,” the authors write.

Mad House: How Donald Trump, MAGA Mean Girls, a Former Used Car Salesman, a Florida Nepo Baby, and a Man With Rats in His Walls Broke Congress, will be published next Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy.

The Times has run excerpts, prominently about how Schumer sat with Biden last July and told him he must relinquish the presidential nomination, little more than 100 days from election day, a disastrous debate having convinced Biden’s own party he was too old to go on.

But it is now Schumer’s turn in the spotlight, under fire from his own party. Last week, Schumer first said Democrats would not help Republicans stave off a government shutdown, then reversed and supported the GOP budget. Enough Democrats followed that the measure passed, promising more draconian cuts.

Schumer told the Times he “knew there would be divisions” but insisted “we are all unified in going after Trump”. But on Monday, amid heavy fire from figures including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman many want to challenge Schumer for his Senate seat, Schumer cancelled a tour for his own book, Antisemitism in America: A Warning.

Karni and Broadwater quote another Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who has prominently gone after Trump and who many see as a Senate leader in waiting. Murphy was “willing to entertain the Schumer theory of the case” about a Republican party rescuable from Trumpism, the authors write. But “he didn’t buy it himself”.

“There are plenty of examples of societies captured by a singularly unique individual demagogue and that get healthy after that person disappears,” Murphy says. “I don’t know. I’m not as optimistic as [Schumer] is. I worry there’s a rot at the core of the country that will continue to be exposed politically.”

Now 74, Schumer entered Congress in 1981. A senator since 1999, he became minority leader in 2016 and was majority leader from 2021 until this year.

Karni and Broadwater describe a 2013 dinner at the Palm, a “see-and-be-seen steakhouse” in Washington, between Schumer, the South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, and the far-right shock jock Rush Limbaugh.

The meeting was brokered by the rightwing media baron Rupert Murdoch, so the senators could sell Limbaugh on immigration reform that offered a path to citizenship to millions of undocumented migrants.

Limbaugh refused to back it so Murdoch backed off too, taking Fox News with him. Republicans, Schumer realized, were “being led by the listeners who had fully bought into the baseless claims and toxic rumors peddled by Limbaugh”. The reform failed. Soon after, Trump seized the GOP.

Schumer discussed that fateful dinner “with his shoes off in his Senate office one night in June 2023 … noshing on gluten-free crackers and serving what he called his ‘special white wine’, one he later conceded he didn’t know much about: it had been picked out by his wife.”

Trump had just been indicted a second time, over his retention of classified records. “Schumer didn’t think it would matter one bit in the presidential election,” the authors write. “On this point, he would be proven correct.”

Schumer also mused on voters who back Trump, wondering why a notional “New York City firefighter” should be “so fucking angry” when he had such a comfortable life. Schumer posited that the firefighter was made “so fucking mad” by “this technological revolution” and the ensuing loss of “family, community, religion”.

“Trump, who’s an evil sorcerer, comes in, he says, ‘I can get that old world back.’”

But according to Karni and Broadwater, Schumer did not harbor such realism about Trump’s party.

“Despite all facts to the contrary, it was a core belief of Schumer’s that politics in America would recalibrate after Trump exited the stage. Driving through Brooklyn months before the shattering election cycle, Schumer repeated the sentiment.”

Schumer thought 25 Republican senators “were scared of Trump” but “those people, if Trump is gone, will go back”.

Karni and Broadwater add: “Schumer was bullish on everything, especially after Biden’s dramatic exit from the race.

“He liked telling people that Robert Caro, the famed biographer of President Lyndon B Johnson, had referred to him, Schumer, as the ‘Jewish LBJ’. So, he let himself fantasize about Democrats winning everything, the White House, the Senate, and the dysfunctional House and steamrolling through progressive legislation that would have him live up to the moniker. ‘The one thing I’d really like to do is immigration reform,’ he said. He was still thinking about the 2013 failure … ‘If that bill had passed,’ he said, ‘the country would be a different place.’

1jdfjp3,‘Full of despair’: Senate Dems look to regroup after losing shutdown fight,34,therosx,31,2025-03-17T15:36:01+00:00,"Senate Democrats are bracing for a painful post-mortem as they try to avoid a September rerun of their latest government funding defeat.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and nine of his members helped get a House GOP-authored government funding bill to the finish line, saying a vote to advance legislation they loathed was the least bad option. 

The alternative, they argued, was allowing a shutdown that could empower President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to accelerate their slashing of the federal bureaucracy.

This was the first time since the start of Trump’s second administration that the party had real leverage to fight the president, as Republicans needed Democratic votes to overcome a filibuster. Democrats could have refused to put up those votes to avert a shutdown, but Schumer folded instead. This gambit is now raising internal questions about how Democrats will handle the next shutdown deadline at the end of September — and how they can avoid the same result.
Schumer’s strategy exposed major fissures within the party, marking for many of his members a disappointing retreat. It’s also raised questions among some Democrats about whether it’s time for the New Yorker to step aside — though no senators have publicly embraced those calls.

“We should do a retrospective,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). Asked whether his party lost some of its clout by acquiescing to the GOP’s funding bill, Gallego said: “That was my concern.”

Senate Democrats have already started discussing privately how to avoid getting rolled again. They bet this month that House Republicans would never be able to pass a stopgap funding bill without Democratic support, and Democrats hoped they could leverage that failure into a bipartisan deal. 

That assumption backfired when Speaker Mike Johnson called their bluff, sending the Senate a funding patch that passed the House with only one Republican opposing it.

“We were just talking about that,” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said when asked how the party will pursue the next funding fight. “We’ve got to come up with a plan.”

Some Democrats are now afraid that they inadvertently gave Republicans a playbook for government funding fights in the future: Cut Democrats out of the negotiations, muscle legislation through the House with only GOP votes and bet they can jam the Senate. 

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) pointed to that possibility as he laid out his frustrations after the Senate cleared the funding measure Friday night, warning that Democrats set a “really dangerous precedent” and questioned “why would Republicans work with us” going forward.

This isn’t the first time Democrats have found themselves divided as they learn how to navigate the return of the Trump era. But with a second funding battle looming, not to mention a potential brawl over the debt ceiling, Democrats are warning that they need to quickly find a foothold that unites their caucus and its disparate voices while also delivering results.

Democrats say they need to have a blunt conversation about how much political risk they are willing to absorb to fight Trump, including blocking unrelated legislation or symbolic opposition to nominees. Some Democratic senators are floating holding a series of rallies and town halls to try to build public support for opposing Trump.

“I think our caucus needs to work through how we are going to coordinate a common message and approach,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).

Senate Democrats spent a lot of time last week agonizing over how to handle the government funding fight in closed-door meetings; some became so heated that senators could be heard shouting in the Capitol hallways. 

Schumer gave his colleagues room to air their grievances, which included complaints about the lack of a clear strategy. But he also encouraged them to not outwardly lean into a shutdown threat in the lead-up to the House vote that he hoped would fail.

Many Democratic senators were frank in the final days before the vote that they were barreling toward a lose-lose situation. Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) called the two choices Democrats faced — supporting the House GOP bill or driving the government into a shutdown — “full of despair.”

A Senate Democratic aide, granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said there was a “very clear split in strategy” between Schumer and other senior Democrats ahead of Friday’s vote. The aide said that there needs to be a “reset” heading into the funding fight this fall.

“The leverage point still exists,” the aide added. “It’s just a matter of using it.”

Meanwhile, Republicans have been gloating over Schumer’s missteps. The Democratic leader warned from the Senate floor last week that the House bill did not have the votes to advance in his chamber, only to say the next day that he would help get it over a 60-vote procedural hurdle. Several Republican senators and even Trump complimented him for helping advance the funding bill, even as he ultimately opposed it on passage vote.

Schumer has defended his strategy, arguing that as leader of the caucus he has to make politically painful decisions to protect both his members and the country from what he viewed as a worse alternative: The possibility of a prolonged shutdown with Trump and Musk in the driver’s seat. Schumer privately warned his members ahead of last week’s vote that if the government shut down there was not a clear offramp out of one, and that Republicans could potentially try to cherry pick which parts of the government to reopen.

Schumer, in a sit-down with reporters last week, acknowledged that Republicans could try to jam them again in September. But Schumer said he’s betting that Trump’s actions and policies will make him less popular, which could splinter congressional Republicans in the coming months and give Democrats a “decent chance” at more leverage heading into September negotiations. Other Democratic senators indicated they feel similarly.

“With the failed Trump economic policies, with a market that continues to wobble at best … I think a lot of this is going to start bubbling up,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.).

1jc4tbl,The Trump Administration Says This Law Allows It to Take Away Green Cards. What to Know.,47,therosx,9,2025-03-15T20:49:26+00:00,"The Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student arrested last week after his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, under a seldom-used provision of immigration law. 

https://archive.ph/o/73T51/https://www.wsj.com/us-news/dhs-detains-columbia-student-who-helped-lead-pro-palestinian-protests-fbbd8196

Khalil, a 30-year-old lawful permanent resident, is awaiting his fate in a federal Louisiana immigration detention facility after being arrested in New York on Saturday. 

Free-speech advocates and Khalil’s attorneys have lambasted the arrest as retaliation for protected speech. Khalil hasn’t been charged with a crime. The Department of Homeland Security said that Immigration Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil in compliance with President Trump’s executive orders targeting antisemitism on college campuses. 

Here’s what to know about what could happen next. 

WHEN CAN THE UNITED STATES TAKE AWAY A NONCITIZEN’S GREEN CARD?

The government can attempt to strip a person of their permanent resident status in certain cases, such as where they’ve committed a serious crime or if they’ve obtained their green card through fraud.        
An immigration judge makes the final decision about whether a person’s green card can be revoked. Immigrants have the right to fight the government’s case. 

Khalil obtained his green card, or his status as a lawful permanent resident, by marrying a U.S. citizen. 

WHAT GIVES HOMELAND SECURITY THE AUTHORITY TO DEPORT KHALIL? 

The government is claiming it has the right to take away Khalil’s green card and deport him under Section 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The law specifies that a person can be removed from the country if the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe that person’s presence or activities “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the U.S. 
Non-citizens don’t need to be charged with a crime to be deported through this process. 

This provision generally doesn’t allow someone to be deported for beliefs, statements, or associations that would otherwise be legal—but the Secretary of State, in this case Marco Rubio, can overrule that if he determines the person’s actions would jeopardize a compelling foreign policy interest. 

The government hasn’t formally outlined exactly how Khalil’s presence in the country is jeopardizing a compelling foreign policy interest. Rubio and other Trump administration officials have backed efforts to remove Khalil, accusing him of “siding with terrorists” and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students on college campuses. Combatting antisemitism is one of the Trump administration’s foreign policy objectives. 

DOES THE GOVERNMENT REGULARLY REMOVE NONCITIZENS USING THIS PROVISION OF SECTION 237?

No. The U.S. government’s justification for removing Khalil is extremely uncommon.
In the 1990s, the U.S. government tried under the same provision to deport the former deputy attorney general of Mexico, Mario Ruiz Massieu, whom Mexico had been seeking to extradite. Officials argued at the time that it would jeopardize the U.S.’s relationship with Mexico if they didn’t return him to the country. The case was tied up in court for years and wasn’t resolved before Ruiz Massieu’s death in the U.S. in 1999. 

DO GREEN CARD HOLDERS HAVE A RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH?

The Supreme Court has ruled that permanent residents are generally protected by the First Amendment. But several other legal cases have limited permanent residents’ ability to claim First-Amendment rights as a defense against their deportation. 

In a 1952 Supreme Court decision, for example, the court ruled that permanent residents could be deported because they had previously been members of the Communist Party. 

Free-speech advocates have argued that the statute the government is using to try and deport Khalil is an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment because it allows the government to retaliate against speech it dislikes.

That question hasn’t been tested before, and it’s likely Khalil’s case will hinge on what courts decide. 

WHAT IS THE STATUS OF KHALIL’S CASE?

Khalil is currently detained in Louisiana, where he was moved shortly after his arrest in New York. His attorneys filed suit in New York, which brought the case to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan. 

There are three major questions before Furman: where the case should be litigated, where Khalil should be during the proceedings, and if Khalil’s detention is legal. 
The government says the case should be argued in Louisiana, where Khalil is now. Khalil’s attorneys say the case should be decided by Judge Furman in New York, where Khalil lives and was initially detained, and that Khalil should be returned to the state and released as soon as possible. 

Being returned to New York would also allow Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, to visit him. 
Furman has not yet ruled on any of these questions. But he has ordered that Khalil cannot be removed from the U.S. without a court order.

As a Canadian, I’ve seen how conservative politics here differ from the U.S., and I wanted to offer a perspective as someone without a dog in the fight.  

I remember when ""conservatism"" was about small government, fiscal responsibility, strong foreign policy, and individual liberties. Whether I agreed with it or not, I understood it. But looking at American conservatism today, especially the MAGA wing, I have to ask—what happened?  

**Spending & Debt:** Conservatives used to be the ones warning about reckless spending. Yet, under Trump, the national debt grew by nearly $8 trillion in just four years, even before COVID spending. Whatever happened to balancing budgets?  

**Law & Order:** Conservatives historically backed law enforcement and a strong rule of law. But then Jan 6 happened, and suddenly, attacking police officers and storming government buildings became… acceptable? That doesn't seem like the conservative values I once recognized.  

**Foreign Policy:** Reagan and Bush were tough on Russia, standing for American strength. Now, MAGA conservatives praise Putin, weaken NATO, and even suggest abandoning Ukraine to an authoritarian regime. What happened to standing up for democracy and American leadership?  

**Moral Values:** Conservatism used to emphasize character, personal responsibility, and traditional values. Now, it seems like scandals, adultery, and outright criminal behavior are just brushed off if it’s someone on ""your side."" Would Reagan or Eisenhower have survived multiple indictments and hush money scandals?  

I get that no political movement is perfect. But from the outside looking in, it seems like MAGA has replaced conservatism with blind loyalty to one man instead of real principles. What do you guys think? Am I missing something?

1j9kvo2,House passes funding bill ahead of Friday shutdown deadline in win for Republicans,30,therosx,15,2025-03-12T14:06:36+00:00,"Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday succeeded in a high-stakes House vote to pass President Donald Trump’s plan to fund the government into the fall, overcoming far-right opposition as the GOP scrambles to avert a government shutdown Friday at midnight.

The 217-213 vote to approve Republicans’ stopgap bill saw just one GOP defection, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and now amplifies pressure on Senate Democrats to decide whether to back the measure – or trigger a spending showdown with Trump and risk a potential shutdown.

The House plans to immediately leave Washington — an attempt to stick the Senate with a take-it-or-leave-it bill ahead of the March 14 deadline. But it’s not yet clear whether Johnson’s show of force will be enough to convince Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to stave off a shutdown.

At least eight Senate Democrats would need to vote with the GOP to accept the bill, which includes none of the concessions the party has been demanding to protect Congress’ spending powers in the Trump era.

Senate Democrats will hold a meeting Wednesday where they are expected to discuss their position on the House GOP funding plan, according to multiple people familiar with the planning.

While the fate of the measure remains uncertain, House Republicans cheered the passage of their bill as a major win for Trump, convincing even some of the GOP’s staunchest conservatives to back a bill that mostly funds the government at levels that former President Joe Biden signed into law, along with $13 billion in cuts for certain domestic programs.

House Democrats, meanwhile, were largely united against the measure. “The strong House Democratic vote in opposition to this reckless Republican spending bill speaks for itself,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday evening.

Top House Democrats, led by Jeffries, had led their own fierce whip operation, and ultimately lost one of their own members, Maine Rep. Jared Golden, on the vote.

“Even a brief shutdown would introduce even more chaos and uncertainty at a time when our country can ill-afford it,” Golden said in a post on X explaining his vote. “My vote today reflects my commitment to making tough choices and doing my job for the people of Maine.”

In the hours before the vote, Johnson was still working to get his members in line, but his team succeeded with the help of a full-court press by Trump and his White House team. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegetth, budget chief Russ Vought and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles all repeatedly phoned members to support the bill.

In a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning, Vance warned Republicans that their party could be blamed if the government shut downs, in a last-ditch push to lock down the votes. The vice president told members that the party will “lose momentum” on Trump’s agenda if the short-term spending bill fails, specifically pointing to border security and political momentum, the source said.

“This is how the President has asked us to fight now so that they can do what they’re doing with DOGE, and there will be a point in time where we implement a recissions plan that basically formalizes those cuts,” Rep. Warren Davidson, an ultraconservative who is typically opposed to stopgap spending bills, told CNN.

Conservatives succeeded in getting billions of cuts in the bill, which largely stem from the removal of projects or one-time initiatives funded by lawmakers, known as earmarks. But it also included language that some of their members opposed, like language that would help House members avoid a politically painful up-or-down vote on ending President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico.

“It’s not a clean CR,” one GOP appropriator told CNN. A “clean” bill, that member said, would be one page.

House Republican’s one holdout, Massie, said he was not worried about his future, even as the president threatens a primary challenge against him for his defiance.

The Kentucky Republican said he doubted Trump could back a successful primary effort against him and thinks the president threatened him to “keep other Republicans in line.”

“I don’t think they were meant to change my vote because they know they can’t change my vote. They don’t even call me,” he said.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1j9kvo2/house_passes_funding_bill_ahead_of_friday/,Tuesday,0.97,,False

1j78fd6,Montana Legislature green lights Medicaid expansion as Congress considers program cuts,47,therosx,7,2025-03-09T14:10:51+00:00,"A Republican proposal to leave current levels of Medicaid coverage in place in Montana is headed to the governor's desk as Congress considers billions of dollars in cuts to the low-income health program.

The Montana Senate gave final legislative approval to the bill in a 30-20 vote Feb 27. Expanded coverage had been set to expire on the safety net program that insures more than 76,000 Montana residents. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte has voiced support for continuing coverage, but has not commented on the specific proposal.

A coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats carried the bill across the finish line, after effectively wresting control of the Senate agenda from conservative GOP leaders in recent days. The measure includes new work requirements for some Montana Medicaid enrollees, criteria that had been blocked under former President Joe Biden.

In 2015, Montana lawmakers voted to extend Medicaid coverage to adults between the ages of 18 and 65 with annual incomes slightly higher than the federal poverty level. Before the Affordable Care Act let states extend coverage to this group, the program was limited to disabled, pregnant and elderly people, and children in low-income households. It now insures nearly 80 million people nationwide.

The state renewed the expanded program in 2019, but set an expiration date for this summer. Under the latest bill, lawmakers would no longer need to periodically renew the program.

State Rep. Ed Buttrey, a Great Falls Republican and the bill’s sponsor, said the program has been a lifeline for low-income residents and the state’s rural health care providers, which no longer need to spend as much money caring for uninsured patients.

Medicaid expansion has especially benefitted Montana's Native American population, improving health outcomes and treatment access, while taking the strain off the overburdened Indian Health Services.

Most states receive extra federal funding for expanding Medicaid coverage to more residents. In Montana, the federal government currently foots about 90 percent of the $1 billion annual bill.

Republican opponents such as state Sen. Carl Glimm of Kila warned Montana could soon be saddled with much higher costs if Congress cuts funding for the states. The $880 billion Medicaid program is a prime target for the GOP-controlled body as it looks to slash federal spending.

Montana is one of nine states with trigger laws automatically or almost automatically ending Medicaid expansion if the federal government decides to cover less of the cost. Its law requires the state to identify additional funding if the federal contribution rate drops.

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has also floated imposing work requirements, which would limit Medicaid coverage to qualified people who are actively working, volunteering or otherwise engaging in their community. Montana and other states have previously attached work requirements to Medicaid expansion plans, but they were blocked from taking effect by the Biden administration.

About 92 percent of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by the health policy research firm KFF.

The bill headed for Gianforte's desk renews the state's own push for work requirements, which President Donald Trump's administration may be more likely to approve.

It’s a safety net we need to have, but we also have to make sure the people that get in the safety net doesn’t cause the safety net to collapse under its weight,” Gianforte said recently.

Republican governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have also announced plans to seek approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements. South Dakota voters signed off last year on a plan to add a similar rule, which also requires federal approval. About 18,000 people lost coverage when Arkansas enacted work requirements during the first Trump presidency but those were later blocked by a federal judge.

1j5zuj3,Poland seeks access to nuclear arms and looks to build half-million-man army,85,therosx,26,2025-03-07T20:42:42+00:00,"Poland will look at gaining access to nuclear weapons and also ensure that every man undergoes military training as part of an effort to build a 500,000-strong army to face off the threat from Russia, Prime Minister Donald Tusk told the parliament on Friday.

Poland's dramatic military expansion comes as fears grow across Europe that U.S. President Donald Trump is aligning with the Kremlin and turning his back on America's traditional western alliances — a geopolitical shift that Warsaw regards as a potentially existential threat.

Tusk said that Poland ""is talking seriously"" with France about being protected by the French nuclear umbrella. President Emmanuel Macron has opened the possibility of other countries discussing how France’s nuclear deterrent can protect Europe.

Tusk also stressed that Poland cannot restrict itself to conventional weapons.

""We must be aware that Poland must reach for the most modern capabilities also related to nuclear weapons and modern unconventional weapons ... this is a race for security, not for war,"" he said.
He pointed to the example of Ukraine, which gave up is nuclear arsenal and is now being attacked by Russia.

He also talked about a massive upscaling of Poland's conventional military forces.

""By the end of the year, we want to have a model ready so that every adult male 
in Poland is trained for war, and so that this reserve is adequate for possible threats,"" Tusk said.

The Polish military is now about 200,000, which makes it the third-largest in NATO after the U.S. and Turkey and the largest among the alliance's EU members. Tusk pointed out that Ukraine has an army of about 800,000 while Russia has 1.3 million men under arms.

""Every healthy man should want to train to be able to defend the homeland in case of need. We will prepare it in such a way that it will not be a burden on people,"" Tusk said, adding that women would also be able to volunteer, but that ""war is still, to a greater extent, the domain of men.""

Tusk underlined this is not a return to conscription, which ended in Poland in 2008.
But that decision was taken in a very different time.

Now, growing fear about Russia, added to worry about the reliability of Poland's traditional alliance with the United States, is prompting a revolution in military planning.

""Poles will not adopt the philosophy that we are completely powerless and helpless, if President Trump has decided to adjust policy,"" Tusk said.

But he added that Poland is not giving up on NATO.

""Poland is not changing its opinion on the need, the absolutely fundamental need to maintain the closest possible ties with the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is in general indisputable,"" he said.

Poland is already NATO's top spender, with its defense budget accounting for 4.7 percent of gross domestic product this year. Tusk told parliament that spending should increase to 5 percent of GDP — a figure touted by U.S. President Trump.

Poland is is spending billions on weapons — Abrams tanks, Patriot missile defense systems and F-35 jet fighters from the U.S. as well as K2 Black Panther main battle tanks,  K9A1 Thunder howitzers, Homar-K rocket systems and jet trainers from South Korea.

The confusing signals coming out of the Trump administration are particularly worrying for Poland, which has built its security architecture around its close ties with the U.S. There are about 10,000 American soldiers stationed in Poland, and the country makes an effort to buy U.S. weapons systems — to the annoyance of other European countries.

But the sight of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy being berated in the White House, the U.S. ending arms aid to Ukraine, and Donald Trump's comments that the U.S. may not fulfill its NATO obligations to protect members against attack if he feels they are not spending enough on defense are very concerning.

“We are seeing a deep correction in U.S. policy with regard to Ukraine but we can’t turn our backs to it only because we don’t like it. We must be precise and honest in assessing what it means and what serves our interest and what doesn’t,” Tusk told parliament.

He insisted that Europe has the economic potential to stand up to Russia.

“Our deficit has been the lack of the will to act, having no confidence, and sometimes even cowardice. But Russia will be helpless against united Europe,” Tusk said, adding: “It’s striking but it’s true. Right now, 500 million Europeans are begging 300 million Americans for protection from 140 million Russians who have been unable to overcome 50 million Ukrainians for three years.""

He also said Poland would take steps to withdraw from international treaties banning the use of anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions.

Despite the planned military buildup, Tusk insisted that Polish troops would not be sent to Ukraine to police any peace agreement — something France and the U.K. are considering.

“Poland's job is to guard its eastern border, which is also the border of NATO and the European Union,"" he said.

1j4wblq,"Trump to revoke legal status for 240,000 Ukrainians as US steps up deportations",128,therosx,42,2025-03-06T14:12:19+00:00,"U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is planning to revoke temporary legal status for some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled the conflict with Russia, a senior Trump official and three sources familiar with the matter said, potentially putting them on a fast-track to deportation.

The move, expected as soon as April, would be a stunning reversal of the welcome Ukrainians received under President Joe Biden's administration.

The planned rollback of protections for Ukrainians was underway before Trump publicly feuded with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week. It is part of a broader Trump administration effort to strip legal status from more than 1.8 million migrants allowed to enter the U.S. under temporary humanitarian parole programs launched under the Biden administration, the sources said.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the department had no announcements at this time. The White House and Ukrainian embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

A Trump executive order issued on January 20 called for DHS to ""terminate all categorical parole programs.""

The administration plans to revoke parole for about 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans as soon as this month, the Trump official and one of the sources familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The plan to revoke parole for those nationalities was first reported, opens new tab by CBS News.

Migrants stripped of their parole status could face fast-track deportation proceedings, according to an internal ICE email seen by Reuters.

Immigrants who cross the border illegally can be put into the fast-track deportation process known as expedited removal, for two years after they enter. But for those who entered through legal ports of entry without being officially ""admitted"" to the U.S. - as with those on parole - there is no time limit on their rapid removal, the email said.

The Biden programs were part of a broader effort to create temporary legal pathways to deter illegal immigration and provide humanitarian relief.

In addition to the 240,000 Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, and the 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, these programs covered more than 70,000 Afghans escaping the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.
An additional 1 million migrants scheduled a time to cross at a legal border crossing via an app known as CBP One.

U.S. allies from Afghanistan who entered under Biden have also been swept up in Trump's crackdown.
Rafi, a former Afghan intelligence officer who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect family members still in Afghanistan, entered the U.S. legally in January 2024 using the CBP One mobile app at the U.S.-Mexico border. He was given a temporary humanitarian parole status that allowed him to live and work in the United States for two years.

On February 13, just over a year into that status, he was detained at a check-in appointment at an ICE office in Chantilly, Virginia. His status was revoked.

In Afghanistan, Rafi was trained by American officers and provided intelligence on “High Value Targets”, according to an October 2022 recommendation letter.

“As a result of his active efforts against the enemy, he is currently in extreme danger, and in need of assistance in departing the country,” the former CIA officer who trained him wrote.

The officer described Rafi as “truly one of the most dedicated and hardworking individuals I had the honor to serve with in Afghanistan.” Reuters reviewed the letter but was not able to reach the officer.
In the United States, Rafi applied for asylum and was scheduled for a hearing before an immigration judge in April.

1j1tr86,"Elon Musk, a key figure in President Donald Trump’s administration and head of the United States Department of Government Efficiency, has backed calls for the United States to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).",122,therosx,78,2025-03-02T15:46:41+00:00,"Musk voiced his support on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday night when he responded “I agree” to a post stating, “It’s time to leave NATO and the UN.” His endorsement aligns with growing calls from some Republican lawmakers, including Senator Mike Lee, to reconsider the US commitment to the alliance.

Lee, a long-time critic of NATO, has described it as a “Cold War relic” and argued that the alliance “has to come to a halt.” He claims NATO is a “great deal for Europe” but a “raw deal for America”, suggesting that US resources are being stretched to protect Europe while offering little direct benefit to American security.

Musk’s comments come amid broader discussions within the Trump administration over the future of America’s role in NATO and international alliances.

While Trump has not explicitly stated his intent to withdraw from NATO, he has repeatedly pressured European nations to increase their defence spending, warning that the US should not bear the financial burden of the alliance alone.

As a key figure in the administration, Musk’s influence on Trump’s policy decisions is significant. His endorsement of a NATO withdrawal could signal growing momentum within the White House for a shift towards a more isolationist foreign policy, focusing on domestic defence priorities over international commitments.

With the war in Ukraine ongoing and NATO playing a critical role in supplying military aid, any US withdrawal would drastically reshape the global security landscape. European leaders have already expressed concerns over Trump’s stance on NATO, particularly as the alliance works to counter Russian aggression and maintain stability in Eastern Europe.

Despite Musk and Lee’s calls for withdrawal, Trump has continued to engage with NATO leaders, recently hosting UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington for discussions on European security. However, with Trump’s administration pushing for major shifts in US foreign policy, NATO’s future role in American defence strategy remains uncertain.

“It is clear that the Trump Administration’s foreign assistance ‘review’ was not a serious effort or attempt at reform but rather a pretext to dismantle decades of U.S. investment that makes America safer, stronger and more prosperous. There is no indication Secretary Rubio conducted a program-by-program review of the more than 9,000 awards or considered the dire national security implications of these rash actions. 

Ending programs first and asking questions later only jeopardizes millions of lives and creates a power vacuum for our adversaries like China and Russia to fill. 

“While it’s easy to assume that these cuts will only affect people thousands of miles away, the fact is, the impact will be felt by American farmers who will no longer get top dollar for their crops to feed the hungry, churches who will no longer have the support of the U.S. government in their missions, American families who fall sick when diseases like Zika, Ebola and Malaria once again reach our shores and U.S. biotech companies who will no longer sell their drugs to treat the vulnerable overseas.

My belief stems from the following premises:

1)The Trump mandate to concentrate power within the Presidents office of the executive branch of the federal government comes from a group of voters who believe that the current system is systemically oppressive against their demographic. That it is fundamentally corrupt, criminal and run by malevolent actors hiding from the public eye within the bureaucracy and adjacent corporations that enrich themselves using tax paper money to the detriment of their demographic. This perspective seems to exist within the WOKE, Anti-Woke and MAGA movements which all share elements of populism.

2)This populist story of systemic corruption and intolerance is primarily propagated via political entertainment media and has been created as a shared mythology over the course of the past 20 years of American history. I choose to believe this media history started with the conservative shock jocks of the southern United States then evolved to the cable networks under Rupert Murdock. Rupert Murdock's business model was then adopted by television pioneers such as Geraldo Rivera, Dr. Phil, Glen Beck, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones and others.

During the period between cable conservative political entertainment and the rise of common broadband internet and the ability for social media to make large amounts of money there was a phenomenon within American universities and academia. Civil rights enjoyed many victories during this period including gay marriage, justice for woman in the workplace, and the birth of a thriving humanities industry within academia.

Higher standards of living allowed more students than ever to attend college and this influx created new incentives for universities to attract these students. A focus was placed on campus life, clubs, exercise facilities and social groups where students could network and not only earn the qualifications for employment but grow as people. This focus on attracting new students necessitated an increase in administrative spending on campus. Increasing admin staff and shifting focus to beatification of campuses, dorms and extracurricular activities.

During this period many students found themselves struggling to pass courses in pursuit to their degrees and diplomas as is normal for higher education. Especially past the first two years as students burn out from constant work as well as the lure and incentive of enjoying their new found freedom, youth and ability to explore themselves and the world with new and interesting people.

As a result the humanities degrees became a popular option for students who wished to continue their campus experiences with a lighter work load. This boom in the humanity students exposed a generation to Critical Theory, Deconstructionism and what are referred to on campus as “Studies”.

These popular programs originally focused around the class struggle. Referencing wealth disparity, revolutionary movements and changes in government. In the period of the 90’s to 2010’s many of these same principles were adapted to focus on civil rights, race, sexual orientation and group identity. These programs were popular and as students graduated from these studies programs they naturally wished to find employment suitable for their education.

This created a new industry of social awareness and the humanities across the western world. The industry was primarily marketed not to the masses however, but to elites. Book publishers, corporations, charities, non-profits, community groups, and of course back to universities themselves.

This explosion of professionals looking for employment within their industry eventually reached a saturation point where there was too many looking for too few positions. This is when the humanities began to leak into the mainstream.

3) With an ever increasing pool of university graduates looking for work and an ever smaller slice of the available funding two main consequences emerged that would go on to effect the traditional right wing political entertainment I mentioned earlier. The first was the increasing incentives of progressive graduates looking to make a name for themselves to go after and denigrate the progressive activists, academics, and key holders that had gone before them.

Targeting the right wing, white and Christian supremacist, the republican party and corporations were popular in university did not yield them the results they were looking for however as they were preaching to the choir and needed a way to stand out and be noticed. Attacking left wing establishment solved this issue and gave them attention and opportunities to not only get noticed but take over from those currently occupying the positions they wanted. The social media explosion helped facilitate these attacks and gave them coverage and publicity that not even the well funded establishment social groups could match.

An example would be 4th wave feminists attacking 2nd and 3rd wave feminists on the grounds that as the establishment they were unworthy of carrying the cause into the future, were hoarding the money for their benefit and had not modernized their old ways of thinking to keep pace with the systemically oppressed groups of today.

The second consequence of this booming industry was making the right wing political entertainment industries aware of the money that could be made as well as the advantages of bypassing traditional media gatekeepers to reach audiences directly, cutting out expensive networks, unions, talent agencies and advertisers to keep the money directly.

The increasingly radical rhetoric coming from these humanities graduates were causing blowback into right wing media and did not go unnoticed by pioneers in the field such as Ben Shapiro, Tim Pool, and Steven Crowder. The Tea Party movement had also shown the power of social media and that existing corporations could co-opt these movements and use them to sell merchandise. The smartest right wing entertainers saw something even more valuable than selling merchandise and ads however. They saw a way to give something their audience was looking for but didn’t realize they didn’t have. An identity.

4) WOKE and Anti-WOKE are functionally the same product. While both identities come from different directions they share similar core political beliefs, assumptions, and behavior. They both chip away at the traditional definition of Liberalism which has allowed America and the western world to achieve so much in the hundreds of years since the transition away from monarchies and nationalism. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism)

Before I continue on, I will say that my definitions of WOKE and MAGA are those commonly attributed to the most extreme activists and consumers of their respective cultures. Like any identity or ideology it is a spectrum where the personality, background and circumstances of the individual will dictate how much they express these identities. For the purposes of this effort post I will be referring to both WOKE and MAGA as Populists, due to their uniting similarities and behavior, not their perspective on race, religion, sex, or other tangible subjects with history and data that can be appealed to. Instead, my focus is on the beliefs, behavior, perspective and mentality they both share. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism)

My first experience with WOKE happened in 2016 when Jordan Peterson made Canadian news with his opposition of Bill C-16 which added gender expression and gender identity as protected grounds to the Canadian Human Rights Act which put them in the same category as hate propaganda, incitement to genocide and aggravating factors in sentencing. It was not the legislation that made me aware of this however but the YouTube algorithm which showed me recorded videos of university students confronting Professor Peterson at the University of Toronto. The videos showed overly emotional students angrily harassing Professor Peterson with slogans, slurs and shallow one-dimensional accusations. It was infuriating to watch them and when Professor Peterson calmly defended himself, attempting to reach out and find common ground with them it created a sharp contrast that you couldn’t help admire.

I believe Peterson was the exact right person in the right place and right time to showcase the worse impulses and excesses of the most extreme activists of what would be known as WOKE with Petersons own university lectures on liberalism and psychology in politics. Particularly the psychology of the former Soviet Union and the corruption of communism into authoritarianism.

To add more credibility to Peterson, he repeatedly accepted interviews and was attacked by unprepared journalists, activists, and political pundits who thought Peterson to be just another right wing crank in the same vein as Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson. Someone easy to bait and reveal to the audience that they had an ideology of hate and intolerance and that this is why the WOKE movement (and humanities graduates) was needed.

They thought wrong in my opinion.

Peterson Destroys! Was a common phenomenon on YouTube in those days. He was an educated well-spoken psychologist and professor. Able to drive his attackers to bouts of emotion, identify flaws in their logic and to admonish them for disregarding the rule of law and weaponizing government and corporations to defeat (cancel) those they saw as the enemy of the oppressed and corruptors of the system.

These videos took the internet by storm and rose in popularity along with Ben Shapiro destroying students in halls, Steven “Change my mind” Crowder doing his bit with students on campus and podcast sensation Joe Rogan platforming all of these rising stars and exposing them to a generation of young people with no sense of identity or belonging in an increasingly digital world and highly competitive job market.

The Anti-Woke industry was created but unlike it’s progenitor it was far superior as a generator of fame and revenue. Anti-Woke had no need for elite institutions or social groups. As a counter culture movement it had no need for it’s audience to study the humanities in university, read about the philosophers and subject matter experts or join organization and activist groups. Anti-woke could be practiced by anyone with an internet connection and ability to watch entertaining videos of intelligent well spoken actors calmly dominating supposedly educated and morally superior agents of progressivism.

It didn’t take long for the old guard of right wing political entertainment to see the money to be made and to alter their content accordingly. It was far easier to deconstruct the excesses of “The Left” and how they had infiltrated every level of “The Establishment”. There was no need to offer solutions or promote real life alternatives. All that was required was to attack. Without the need for solutions or nuanced analysis, the anti-woke industry devolved into feelings over facts, in ironic contrast to Ben Shapiro’s famous line of “Facts don’t care about your feelings”. The anti-woke populist audience couldn’t articulate their positions like Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder could however. They lacked an educated foundation to ground anti-woke in their day to day lives. This resulted in the movement become more like a religion and philosophy. They took it on faith that this is how the country worked. Beliefs, feelings, morality and “heart of hearts” became the foundation of the anti-woke movement which made it even more accessible and easy for new people to join in similar to what happened to the WOKE movement.

The woke movement went from academic programs designed to assist oppressed minorities in society and give them opportunities they lacked to a new type of religion to give an identity and purpose to those who never felt they fit in and were resentful at what they viewed as a fundamentally systemically hostile establishment that needed to be changed. Even if they had to burn it down and start from scratch.

The anti-woke movement saw oppressed professors, comedians, news pundits and politicians getting canceled and felt resentful at what they viewed as a fundamentally systemically hostile establishment that needed to be changed. Even if they had to burn it down and start from scratch.

While the woke movement did hold some power in HR departments, political action groups and especially universities they were relatively few in number. Meanwhile the anti-woke movement held massive audiences of people struggling with life, had time on their hands and little practical job experience.

The western world was primed and ready for someone to tap into this energy.

5) Donald Trump had run for president several times before 2015. He was a showman and TV icon at this point in his life. In the past Trump would run for president as a PR stunt to promote whatever project he was currently working on. In this case it was his hit show The Apprentice where he played a successful CEO lording over potential hires looking to make it into business. The episodes were scripted, the outcomes predetermined and the “candid” moments often reshot if Trump did not like the take. The highly produced reality TV show had once again made Trump a fortune in a long and scandalous life where he had been forced to declare bankruptcy six times.

For all his faults Donald Trump does have an excellent talent for marketing, media and knowing how to test words and ideas like chief tests a new sauce or drink. Trump learned from the Obama birther movement that there was an audience ready and waiting for him to co-opt and lead.

This audience believed in systemic oppression by an establishment that wanted to cancel and subjugate them. Who was stealing their heritage, culture, money and pride to give to unworthy outsiders who already enjoyed a privileged and unfair advantage over them.

Even better for Trump was how this audience already had dozens of leaders who had no love of establishment media or government who were more than willing to support a dark horse underdog in this election.

To the constant shock of the world Donald Trump went for the throat of every Republican candidate and won the primary. He took power from the media and gave it to himself using Twitter and YouTube like no other political candidate ever did before.  He had BOTH the WOKE and Anti-Woke industries working for his campaign for free. Every gaff or outrage he created was covered by an equal gaff or outrage promoted by alternative media.

Any contradictions, lies or misspeaks were countered by the same on the other side, promoted even more by friendly media.

Then the election came and to everyone’s surprise including Trumps own chief of staff, he won. Not because he was the better choice for president or had the most funding and support. Trump won because he had taken an identity and turned it into a mythology, he’d taken entertainers and made them priests and he’d taken an audience and made them a congregation. It wasn’t the majority of America but it was enough for him to win and in the American system its winner take all.

6) Like most people, the election of Donald Trump and the creation of the MAGA movement surprised me. I assumed just like with the tea party that now that a Republican was in power the movement would die down and things would go back to normal. Not only did that not happen but it was also created the now normal, 365 day never ending campaign season, which Democrats only just acknowledged after their recent election loss this past year.

The woke excesses of the Peterson era were over. COVID had wiped out the “campus experience”. Humanities departments were gutted, universities laid off administrators, the DEI clubs were gone and the saturation of DEI graduate made job prospects difficult. The only money to be made was in attacking Democrats online but that audience was much smaller and dominated by a few companies like The Young Turks and Twitch (Hassan Piker) who were thriving attacking Democrats and the establishment.

The anti-woke and MAGA industries continued on and grew. Grievance entertainment remained big. COVID kept the anti-establishment resentment alive. BLM riots breathed life into the anti-left industry and even tho most of the predictions from anti-woke pundits failed to happen they never lost their audiences and with Trump’s loss and the Jan 6 riot, they had more outrage and conspiracy to give.

These media personalities were now joined by thousands of podcasters. Inspired by the media switch during COVID and looking to make it rich. Desperate for an audience they to began preaching to the MAGA religion and were rewarded.

Trump was rewarded as well and when he announced he was running again, desperate for the protection being a presidential candidate would give him in delaying his four indictments for Jan 6, and short on cash to pay lost lawsuits, he still had the MAGA faith ready to denigrate his enemies and cover for his flaws. Not even because they like Trump or condone his worst behavior either but because they believe that WOKE and democrats were so much worse. When your enemy is the Devil and your country Hell, even someone like Trump looks good by comparison and can be supported in good conscience.

7) For those not convinced about the similarities between WOKE and MAGA I’d like to make my case here. Then finally say why I think moderates can bring these people back and why we should not lose hope.   

While the woke left and MAGA right hate each other, they both hate liberalism as well. They both believe in oppressor-victim modes of thinking. They both believe in conspiracy of powerful elites working together behind the scenes to keep them down. They both believe America to be a corrupt and unsalvageable Hell that cannot be saved and must be destroyed so that something better can take it’s place. For MAGA it’s an imaginary past that never existed. For WOKE it’s an imaginary future that can never be. Their hatred towards their enemies is absolute and nothing could ever convince them to join or give them an inch of charity.

These are the people who will cut off family, friends and social groups in real life.

Both WOKE and MAGA see themselves more as part of a group than as individuals. Individuals are responsible for their words and actions. Groups on the other hand have a higher purpose and aren’t subject to the same rules. They both believe that oppressed groups in particular are to be given more credit and held to a lower standard then the oppressor group who should be bound by the law but never protected by it. Identity is at the heart of their passion but it’s more complicated than simple race, religion, sex / gender, or history. To them it’s about a shared culture. WOKE and MAGA are both willing to accept a diversity of opinion so long as they don’t disagree about their shared culture.

Both groups are both hateful and hypocritical although they will often never acknowledge these traits in themselves but will see them in everyone else. They will hate elites but not their elites. They will hate corporations but not their corporations. They hate established laws, information sources and history unless it’s to their benefit. They will believe outlandish conspiracy theories on their side but will deconstruct and analyse their enemies conspiracy theories down to an incredible level.

I’ve personally seen Joe Rogan methodically explain why flat earthers are stupid but in the same interview defend that the moon landing was a hoax and completely ignore the logic and information sources he cited 10 minutes earlier.

8) Populists like WOKE and MAGA are fundamentally locked into a perspective of oppressor and oppressed narratives where they not only believe but desire a nefarious, coherent plan by elites to subjugate them. Not because they are suffering, but because they are not suffering.

The standard of living in America and the western world is high. It’s easy to forget that with a steady information diet of tragedy, injustice, crime, corruption, and emergencies but the truth is in 2025 even the most worse off homeless person has advantages that the greatest emperor didn’t a thousand years ago.

The past was awful for everyone. Simple modern conveniences like the washing machine, the light bulb, plumbing and hot clean water from the tap have totally changed our species life style. Changes in agricultural which employed 40% of the population in my grandfathers time now only needs 2% to feed many times the population. Mega cities, social mobility, community mobility and class mobility are now considered the norm rather than exception. Men and Woman enjoy parody never seen in society outside of a couple in the wilderness both struggling together just to survive. The freedom to explore and grow is available to even the very poor with only those born heavily disabled or disabled by parenting or circumstance not at least having a chance to achieve more than their parents.

I believe the suffering of the populists is shallow. The ideology of MAGA and WOKE is weak and if confronted in the real world and presented with attractive alternatives those people will abandon the lifestyle and perspective they’ve chosen to adopt and adopt something better.

For solutions I don’t have all the answers but I do have practical examples in my own life that have worked with acquaintances and coworkers which I will share here. First is to unplug from social media and find a new social group. Environment both digital and real, shape us like a glass shapes water. Humans aren’t truth seeking animals, we’re social animals. We will adopt the social norms of our groups. Second is to provide an attractive alternative. Group identity is attractive for those who have no individual identity or an individual identity that they hate. To get someone to change how they see themselves we need to provide a blueprint of what that other self looks like. This is what the WOKE movement never managed to provide in my opinion. In the absence of an acceptable and defined alternative they chose to accept everything and nothing causing social friction and making it difficult to coordinate.

For MAGA I think its to shift people from a Selfish Predator to Selfless Protector mentally, where sacrificing for others is rewarded and selfish behavior is discouraged. It’s easier to destroy than create, but when we put the time and energy to create we tend to support those looking to destroy less favorably. Trump is losing popularity right now because he and Musk are being too sloppy and indiscriminate with their cuts. MAGA was fine with it in theory but as we are seeing, once that destruction starts to affect them personally, they change their opinion. Once someone changes their opinion its easier to change another one and keep that momentum going. This is why I continue to encourage Republicans not to give into populism and to communicate and reach out to these people and lead them. Show them a better way that addresses real problems and why it’s important to protect the existing institutions and system which protects so many and provides so much prosperity.

For WOKE it’s about welcoming them into the greater tribe. Resentment and bitterness can’t be cured with false validation or empty acceptance. It takes real friendship and real understanding. At its basic level, friends help each other. To reach WOKE we must help them but also expect and reward when they help us. Reciprocity is the foundation of mutual respect and having pride in our actions instead of false pride in our identity.

9) These are my thoughts anyway. For the TLDR I’ve gone over a bit of history of the WOKE, Anti-Woke and MAGA movements as I know it. Shared my thoughts on how university humanities professors, activists, political entertainers and those looking for fame and money take advantage of people who choose group identity over individual identity. How a media savvy showmen like Donald Trump co-opted the existing anti-woke culture to create MAGA and achieve real power in ways the WOKE movement was never able to. I covered some of the similarities between the two groups and how group identify and oppressor oppressed power dynamics fuel animosity and a desire to destroy the established system. Finally, I laid out some ideas for how to lure those who choose group identity to once again see the world as a wonderful adventure rather than a living hell consumed with corruption and people who hate them.

I think the Liberal Western establishment is worth saving and is strong enough to survive Populism and the information revolution of social media and a new generation that is disconnected from social groups.

I hope this effort post was enough to earn myself flair. Thank you all for reading and I welcome all criticism and discussion about what I wrote.

I'll add that this is my opinion and is based on my own political journey and experiences. I am neither a historian or journalist nor demand anyone take my words as gospel or that i'm above criticism. I also wanted to keep it down to less that 5000 words.

Thanks again.

1iw7chn,“Time is running out” Lawmakers scramble for a deal to stop a shutdown.,39,therosx,14,2025-02-23T10:34:11+00:00,"
A Capitol Hill clash over President Donald Trump’s extraordinary moves to take control of federal spending is upping the chances that lawmakers won’t have a deal to fund the government before a shutdown deadline in just three weeks.

Talks between the top appropriators in the House and Senate have soured in the past week, with lawmakers still searching for an agreement on topline spending levels that are a prerequisite for funding individual agencies and programs for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Negotiators have insisted they are staying at the table to hash out an accord. But there’s no clear strategy to break the logjam, and House Republican leaders privately acknowledge that contingency plans need to be drawn up in case the impasse continues ahead of the March 14 deadline.
“Time is running out,” Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins of Maine told reporters.

The stalemate has been driven in part by partisan distrust over the Trump administration’s remarkable seizure of the federal purse strings. Democrats want assurances from Republicans that the administration will adhere to Congress’s wishes on spending as Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk summarily cut jobs and programs.

“The one thing Rosa DeLauro and I are asking for is simply an assurance that if there’s going to be Democratic votes, that the president and Elon Musk will follow the law, and they won’t just take our bill that we’ve worked really hard on and rip it up and it doesn’t matter,” Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters Thursday, referring to her counterpart on the House Appropriations Committee.

Though more GOP lawmakers are starting to speak out against the executive branch’s unilateral freezing of federal funds, Republican leaders are not likely to agree to checks on Trump’s ability to slash spending.

That has made a continuing resolution, which funds the government under the prior year’s spending levels, look more appealing to members of both parties — though even this alternative poses a risk of a shutdown.

A core group of House Republicans have repeatedly threatened to revolt if their leaders move forward with anything other than 12 individually negotiated spending measures. They want those bills to include certain conservative policy riders and spending cuts.

Democrats, meanwhile, are signaling they won’t bail Republicans out: DeLauro has said that if a long-term continuing resolution were to come to the floor — one that lasts beyond just a few days to let lawmakers put the finishing touches on a full-year bill — it would be “the job of the majority” to pass it.

Murray in a floor speech Thursday called a full-year continuing resolution a “nonstarter” that would end up creating “slush funds for this administration to adjust spending priorities and potentially eliminate longstanding programs as they see fit.”

A stopgap spending bill would also force Congress to lurch weeks or months at a time on status quo spending, bringing uncertainty to agencies that are already besieged by Trump and Musk’s unpredictable personnel cuts. Short-term, flat funding can halt military equipment upgrades, hinder strategic planning and prompt hiring and procurement freezes.

A sign negotiations were beginning to nosedive came Thursday afternoon, when Collins and Murray volunteered within an hour of each other very different readings on the state of the discussions.

Murray insisted negotiators are “extremely close” to landing the topline numbers and that she was in “constant communication” with her Republican colleagues, but didn’t explain how she squared her confidence with the fact that she and DeLauro are pushing for commitments to rein in Musk and Trump that Republicans are unlikely to accept.

Meanwhile, Collins said talks “appear to be at an impasse” after she and House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole of Oklahoma made a joint offer to Democrats on Sunday that had gone without a substantive reply “other than just a perfunctory acknowledgement.”

“I am very disappointed,” Collins said in a brief interview.

The House has been in recess this past week, but members’ return on Monday could bring more clarity to the state of the talks. In interviews at the Capitol over the past few days, senators have expressed hopes of landing a deal so their efforts to negotiate individual funding bills don’t go to waste.

It typically takes at least a month for lawmakers to close out negotiations on the dozen appropriations bills once an overarching agreement on topline spending levels is locked in, but some Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairs say they will be ready to go when — or if — those numbers are delivered.

“We’ve been ready to go for a long time — we get a top line number, we’ll be done like that,” Sen. John Hoeven, chair of the Senate Appropriations Agriculture subcommittee, said in a brief interview, clapping his hands to emphasize the speed at which his panel is prepared to act.

“We’re looking forward to it,” said Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.), chair of the Homeland Security subcommittee, of a toplines deal. “We want to get to work.”

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who leads Democrats on the Agriculture subcommittee, offered a more sobering assessment: “It will be challenging to get something done by the 14th.”",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1iw7chn/time_is_running_out_lawmakers_scramble_for_a_deal/,Tuesday,0.9,,False

1itgtnf,"Kevin D. Williamson - Where’s the Omelet? For Donald Trump, the work stops at breaking eggs.",100,Nklst,14,2025-02-19T21:14:58+00:00,"The thing about Donald Trump is, he’s Donald Trump. 

Briefly set aside any old-fashioned moral considerations about Donald Trump’s low personal character—as a purely analytical matter, that low character is the most direct and comprehensive way to understand what it is the administration is actually doing. That “character is destiny” is a political truism, but it is even more true in the case of Trump than in the case of most politicians, because Trump, being overburdened with an excess of self, has no political interests or values independent of his self-interest, which should be understood in terms that are only partly financial and in the main psychological. Whether as a politician or a peddler of knockoff watches, Donald Trump’s business is being Donald Trump. 

The notion that Trump is some kind of master negotiator is one of the silliest aspects of the Trump cult. He is something closer to the opposite of a dealmaker: Trump is an old-fashioned bully—and one can write that in a way that is merely descriptive rather than pejorative—in the sense that his capacity for action is limited to those points where there is the least resistance. What that means practically is that in domestic affairs, he prefers to act administratively, through executive action rather than in actually negotiating with Congress, which is to say, by commanding subordinates who cannot negotiate with him rather than dealing with legislators who can negotiate, even when that way of doing things limits and hinders his agenda. Internationally, it means that Trump will hector and humiliate relatively weak and friendly countries (Canada) or countries that are in distress and in need of American assistance (Ukraine) while accommodating (in deed and rhetorically) powerful enemies such as Russia and China. A bully acts where he has maximum power over his target. That isn’t a brilliant negotiating strategy—it ensures that you get your way only in those matters in which it is easy to get your way. 

Much has been made of the botched diplomacy of the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, who preemptively conceded to Moscow the bulk of its demands vis-à-vis Ukraine (Ukrainian territory, Ukrainian exclusion from NATO) without even trying to get anything in return. The Hegseth lesson: Hire a cable-news pundit, and he’s going to do cable-news punditry. 

The J.D. Vance lesson is: Hire a troll, and he’s going to troll. And Vance’s trolling has been in some ways more of an error than Hegseth’s kowtowing. The vice president lectures the Europeans about the need for them to “step up” in Ukraine, and then the administration begins a “negotiation” process with Moscow that excludes not only the Ukrainians—who might have views about how their country is to be parceled out—but also our European allies. It is one thing to talk about the Europeans as though they were irrelevant or to treat them that way—but it is an entirely different thing to do so while making them central to your plans for a Ukrainian security settlement—and saying so. The European way of asserting power is not Trump’s swaggering, muscle-flexing style—it is passive-aggressive. It is not very difficult to get the Europeans to agree to do hard and expensive things—it is very difficult to get them to follow through. The Europeans have veto power over a critical element of the Trump administration’s plans for Ukraine (their necessarily large contribution to security arrangements) and the administration has just emphasized for them how useful that veto power can be—while giving them reason to be more inclined to use it rather than less inclined.  

To run roughshod over Canada or Denmark—or the European allies we need for the Ukrainian-led security presence in Ukraine the Trump administration says it wants—is to misunderstand the relevant power calculus. Yes, Canada and Denmark are relatively small and weak compared to the United States. So are most of our European allies. Washington doesn’t need the Europeans to be powerful in comparison to the United States; Washington needs the Europeans to be powerful in comparison to Russia, Iran, and China. And, though we sometimes forget the fact, they are: While the European military capacity is nothing like the American one, it is more than a match for anything Russia or Iran could muster presently; while the European economic capacity is less than the American one (EU GDP will be a little more than $20 trillion this year as compared to $28 trillion for the United States) it is a bit more than the Chinese one (probably a hair under $19 trillion) and is bolstered by critical competencies in manufacturing and sophisticated industrial production. (It is true that there are no Internet-oriented European firms to compare to our American giants, and that illustrates a real failure of the European model; but, in the event of a catastrophic war, what would you rather have: factories building diesel and aviation engines or … Facebook?) Allies are tools, means to practical ends—and intelligent leaders know how to use them as such. Trump and Vance are engaged in grandstanding as a form of therapy for themselves and their social media audiences. 

Another way of explaining all this is that Trump does what he does because of who he is and not in pursuit of a coherent policy agenda. As William Hague wrote in the Times of London: “[H]is version of bringing peace to Ukraine really does involve calling an aggressive dictator for a long chat, cutting out the leader of the country under attack, making concessions in advance of negotiations and completely ignoring the allies who have spent the past three years acting in concert with the US.” Why? For the same reason the first Trump administration never saw him negotiating a durable immigration-reform package or doing more with trade than tinkering around at the edges of NAFTA. Immigration, trade, and crime are the issues in which Trump has long evinced the most interest, and he did almost nothing on any of these. (Violent crime rates were higher on the day Joe Biden beat Trump than on the day Trump took office in 2017, but the change was not dramatic and does not seem to have been driven by federal policy.) And that was Trump’s low character at work: his personal cowardice, his laziness, his refusal to apply himself to anything hard in a consistent and sustained way. But he’ll order people to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America,” because that doesn’t take any work or a difficult negotiation. 

With Trump’s character as a north star, one can get a good idea—with some confidence but by no means with certainty—about what to expect of his second term. Among other things: His strategy for Ukraine will consist of having the occasional telephone call with Vladimir Putin and then tweeting about how wonderful the telephone call was, and Elon Musk et al. will continue their Kulturkampf against the bureaucracy while watching helplessly—and making lame excuses—as spending and the national debt continue to increase rather than decrease or even stabilize. Action on trade and immigration will largely be limited to areas in which the president has some plausible power to act unilaterally, and his strategy for adapting when the courts step in to enforce constitutional limits on executive powers will be to whine about the judges and then do, effectively, nothing. Much of the political action will consist of the use and abuse of executive discretion (pardons of violent criminals, quashing corruption cases against political allies, handing out favors to favor-seeking business interests, etc.) rather than changing the laws or enacting broad structural reforms in federal programs. On tricky issues such as health care, it’ll be another four years of “a concept of a plan” that spends four years being three weeks away from completion.

In an earlier era, Moscow’s apologists and admirers liked to pose as hard-headed realists and declared: “You have to break a few eggs to make an omelet.” George Orwell considered this and asked: “Where’s the omelet?”

We'd just like to restate some basic ground rules and positions of the modteam to make sure we're all on the same page and maintain the environment that Tuesday has managed to craft for itself as a place for high quality and thoughtful discussion focused around policy topics.

**1) Please read our rules.** I have now removed about four or five self posts from the feed over the last week. [Self posts should be policy focused or mod approved effort posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1ar4rgf/tuesday_rule_change_allowing_selfposts/?share_id=eVV3xVYp7mUk-bi6Y4oJF&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) **They should not merely be a question. Questions** should be in the **Discussion Thread (DT)** because we don't moderate and police it as strictly - Left Visitors are free to comment as much as Right Visitors which is restricted on posts outside of the DT. [Here's a short principles discussion from a few years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/qttxnt/new_rules_and_principles_announcement/?share_id=BMMRy3B--Cdjp1HB45DdS&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) For questions we'd prefer to get everyone to be able to have their say and posting it in the DT is the best way for that to happen.

**News articles** posted to the main feed should be focused on policy or institutional problems, and not aimed at a specific politician or individual. We are a policy focused subreddit and we'd like to maintain it that way. 

We will instantly permaban users that engage in the following:

* [Advocacy of court packing (increasing or altering the US Supreme Court's size or configuration in order to hand a partisan advantage to one side).](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/iw8sgw/arguing_for_court_packing_is_an_r2/)
* Support for or advocacy of violence or death or the endorsement of such to political opponents or other civilian actors 
* Election conspiratorialism or the excusal of the acts of those engaging in it.

Do not link to other subreddits via their r/ handle if they are not associated subreddits (Neoliberal and Neocon). We do not want to pester other mods as they receive modmails and we certainly do not want them to brigade our subreddit.

**DO NOT** link to Tuesday in outside subreddits. We try to cultivate an environment for high quality, civil, thoughtful discussion of issues and preserve our centre-right character

**2) Flairs** are mandatory for all users under Rule 3. All users start out with either 'Left Visitor' or 'Right Visitor'. After a prolonged period of engagement in the subreddit you can apply for an ideological flair as a Right Visitor (The list of ideologies is contained in the Resources section). We do not have a 'Centrist' flair because we are a) A centre-right aimed subreddit and b) Would prefer you to state your ideological lean. Even dead centrists usually lean right or left depending on their positions on certain issues. 

We also do not have an 'Independent' flair because we are not an exclusively US forum, which you can gather if you note that I'm British and former mods have also been European. We are a subreddit for the global centre-right, not merely the centre-right of US politics. We are also not partisan Republican.

Persistent argument that does not align with your flair or something that is wildly out of step with what we'd consider a axiomatic part of that identity may result in the moderators altering your flair if we feel you are abusing the RV label in a combination of Rules 3 and 2.

If you would like a custom flair then we would invite you to write an effort post - An essay contributing to some policy area, philosophical thought, a book review of a conservative or policy work. Effort posts should be sent to the mod team for review prior to posting but we appreciate any and all submissions that people produce.

1is223y,Revealed: Trump’s confidential plan to put Ukraine in a stranglehold,93,therosx,34,2025-02-18T02:28:25+00:00,"Donald Trump’s demand for a $500bn (£400bn) “payback” from Ukraine goes far beyond US control over the country’s critical minerals. It covers everything from ports and infrastructure to oil and gas, and the larger resource base of the country.

The terms of the contract that landed at Volodymyr Zelensky’s office a week ago amount to the US economic colonisation of Ukraine, in legal perpetuity. It implies a burden of reparations that cannot possibly be achieved. The document has caused consternation and panic in Kyiv.

The Telegraph has obtained a draft of the pre-decisional contract, marked “Privileged & Confidential’ and dated Feb 7 2025. It states that the US and Ukraine should form a joint investment fund to ensure that “hostile parties to the conflict do not benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine”.

The agreement covers the “economic value associated with resources of Ukraine”, including “mineral resources, oil and gas resources, ports, other infrastructure (as agreed)”, leaving it unclear what else might be encompassed. “This agreement shall be governed by New York law, without regard to conflict of laws principles,” it states.

The US will take 50pc of recurring revenues received by Ukraine from extraction of resources, and 50pc of the financial value of “all new licences issued to third parties” for the future monetisation of resources. There will be “a lien on such revenues” in favour of the US. “That clause means ‘pay us first, and then feed your children’,” said one source close to the negotiations.

It states that “for all future licences, the US will have a right of first refusal for the purchase of exportable minerals”. Washington will have sovereign immunity and acquire near total control over most of Ukraine’s commodity and resource economy. 

The fund “shall have the exclusive right to establish the method, selection criteria, terms, and conditions” of all future licences and projects. And so forth, in this vein. It seems to have been written by private lawyers, not the US departments of state or commerce.

President Zelensky himself proposed the idea of giving the US a direct stake in Ukraine’s rare earth elements and critical minerals on a visit to Trump Tower in September, hoping to smooth the way for continued arms deliveries.

He calculated that it would lead to US companies setting operations on the ground, creating a political tripwire that would deter Vladimir Putin from attacking again.

Some mineral basins are near the front line in eastern Ukraine, or in Russian-occupied areas. He has played up the dangers of letting strategic reserves of titanium, tungsten, uranium, graphite and rare earths fall into Russian hands. “If we are talking about a deal, then let’s do a deal, we are only for it,” he said.

He probably did not expect to be confronted with terms normally imposed on aggressor states defeated in war. They are worse than the financial penalties imposed on Germany and Japan after their defeat in 1945. Both countries were ultimately net recipients of funds from the victorious allies.


A new Versailles

If this draft were accepted, Trump’s demands would amount to a higher share of Ukrainian GDP than reparations imposed on Germany at the Versailles Treaty, later whittled down at the London Conference in 1921, and by the Dawes Plan in 1924. 

At the same time, he seems willing to let Russia off the hook entirely.
Donald Trump told Fox News that Ukraine had “essentially agreed” to hand over $500bn. “They have tremendously valuable land in terms of rare earths, in terms of oil and gas, in terms of other things,” he said.

He warned that Ukraine would be handed to Putin on a plate if it rejected the terms. “They may make a deal. They may not make a deal. 
They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday. But I want this money back,” he said.
Trump said the US had spent $300bn on the war so far, adding that it would be “stupid” to hand over any more. In fact the five packages agreed by Congress total $175bn, of which $70bn was spent in the US on weapons production. 

Some of it is in the form of humanitarian grants, but much of it is lend-lease money that must be repaid.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggested at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend that Trump’s demand was a clever ploy to bolster declining popular support for the Ukrainian cause. “He can go to the American people and say, ‘Ukraine is not a burden, it is a benefit,’” he said.

Sen Graham told the Europeans to root hard for the idea because it locks Washington into defending a future settlement. “If we sign this minerals agreement, Putin is screwed, because Trump will defend the deal,” he said.

Ukrainian officials had to tiptoe though this minefield at the Munich forum, trying to smile gamely and talking up hopes of a resource deal while at the same pleading that the current text breaches Ukrainian law and needs redrafting. Well, indeed.
Talk of Ukraine’s resource wealth has become surreal. A figure of $26 trillion is being cast around for combined mineral reserves and hydrocarbons reserves. The sums are make-believe.

Ukraine probably has the largest lithium basin in Europe. But lithium prices have crashed by 88pc since the bubble burst in 2022. Large reserves are being discovered all over the world. The McDermitt Caldera in Nevada is thought to be the biggest lithium deposit on the planet with 40m metric tonnes, alone enough to catapult the US ahead of China.

The Thacker Pass project will be operational by next year. The value of lithium is in the processing and the downstream industries. Unprocessed rock deposits sitting in Ukraine are all but useless to the US.

It is a similar story for rare earths. They are not rare. Mining companies in the US abandoned the business in the 1990s because profit margins were then too low. The US government was asleep at the wheel and let this happen, waking up to discover that China has acquired a strategic stranglehold over supplies of critical elements needed for hi-tech and advanced weapons. That problem is being resolved.

Ukraine has cobalt but most EV batteries now use lithium ferrous phosphate and no longer need cobalt. Furthermore, sodium-ion and sulphur-based batteries will limit the future demand growth for lithium. So will recycling. One could go on. The mineral scarcity story is wildly exaggerated.

As for Ukraine’s shale gas, a) some of the Yuzivska field lies under Putin control, and b) the western Carpathian reserves are in complex geology with high drilling costs, causing Chevron to pull out, just as it did in Poland. Ukraine has more potential as an exporter of electricity to Europe from renewables and nuclear expansion, but that is not what is on Donald Trump’s mind.

The second violation of Ukraine

Ukraine cannot possibly meet his $500bn demand in any meaningful timeframe, leaving aside the larger matter of whether it is honourable to treat a victim nation in this fashion after it has held the battle line for the liberal democracies at enormous sacrifice for three years. Who really has a debt to whom, may one ask?
“My style of dealmaking is quite simple and straightforward,” says Trump in his book The Art of the Deal. “I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I’m after.”

In genuine commerce the other side can usually walk away. Trump’s demand is iron-fist coercion by a neo-imperial power against a weaker no with its back to the wall, and all for a commodity bonanza that exists chiefly in Trump’s head.

“Often-times the best deal you make is the deal you don’t make,” said Trump, offering another of his pearls.
Zelensky does not have that luxury. He has to pick between the military violation of Ukraine by Putin, and the economic violation of Ukraine by his own ally.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1is223y/revealed_trumps_confidential_plan_to_put_ukraine/,Tuesday,0.9,,False

1iq4bjs,Republicans split on best path to advance Trump's agenda in Congress,22,therosx,19,2025-02-15T15:55:18+00:00,"House and Senate Republicans are charting competing courses to implement President Trump's top agenda items, including boosting funds for security along the U.S. southern border and extending tax cuts.

The Senate budget committee is expected to begin marking up a budget resolution Wednesday that starts the process of reconciliation to provide $175 billion to secure the southern border and $150 billion in new military spending.

""It would be enough money for four years to implement President Trump's border agenda, immigration agenda on the security side,"" budget Chairman Lindsey Graham told reporters in the Capitol on Tuesday.

https://www.c-span.org/program/news-conference/senate-republican-agenda/655656

Graham spoke after a closed-door briefing with other GOP senators, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and border czar Tom Homan. He said the pair begged for additional funding and said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is running out of money.

""After that briefing, if the Republican Party cannot provide the money to the Trump administration to do all the things they need to do to make us safe, we have nobody to blame but ourselves,"" Graham said. ""Because we have the ability through reconciliation to do this, and I just want to do it sooner rather than later.""

One or two bills, that is the question 

Senate Republicans want to proceed with a two-bill approach in order to act more expeditiously on the president's priorities at the border, and then return later this year to address extending tax cuts. GOP senators have expressed concern that combining those items into one bill risks making it too complicated and unwieldy to pass quickly.

""To my friends in the House — we're moving because we have to,"" Graham, R-S.C., said. ""I wish you the best. I want one big beautiful bill, but I cannot and will not go back to South Carolina and justify not supporting the president's immigration plan.""

For months, House Republican leaders have resisted the Senate's two-bill proposal, insisting that it's more prudent to pursue a one-bill approach encompassing top administration priorities like immigration, energy, defense and taxes.

""It's a nonstarter,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., earlier this week of the potential to go with the Senate's budget resolution. Johnson also indicated addressing the debt ceiling, something Trump has requested, will be part of the House plan.

The House has different considerations than the Senate. GOP members say putting the tax component into a separate bill down the road could jeopardize it altogether. House Republicans also have a razor-thin majority to consider, and recognize it can be difficult enough to satisfy the various factions within the conference to get on board with one bill, let alone two.

On Wednesday morning, the House Budget panel released its budget resolution that calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade. The House GOP resolution also increases the country's borrowing authority by $4 trillion.

https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BU/BU00/20250213/117894/BILLS-119NAih.pdf

The committee scheduled a markup on the proposal on Thursday.

The speaker called it a ""key step to start the process"" and acknowledged there would be ""ongoing debates and discussions in the coming weeks.""

The speaker's plan has already been undermined earlier this week when the hardline House Freedom Caucus released its own budget resolution, representing the first of a two-step reconciliation plan.

https://clayhiggins.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HARRMD_001_xml.pdf

""Given the current delay in the House on moving a comprehensive reconciliation bill, moving a smaller targeted bill now makes the most sense to deliver a win for the President and the American people,"" Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., said in a statement.

Trump has previously expressed support for the one-bill path but has also said he cares less about the process and more just that it gets done.

Budget resolution key to unlocking reconciliation

Both chambers are working toward a budget tool called reconciliation in order to achieve their policy goals.

Reconciliation is a process that allows some types of legislation to pass with a simple majority and avoid the threat of a filibuster, which requires 60 senators to overcome. It's the same mechanism that congressional Democrats used to pass parts of former President Joe Biden's legislative agenda.

Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate and can't expect any support from Democrats to get them over the 60-vote threshold, so they want to use reconciliation.

The first step of that process is a budget resolution, which directs various committees to develop legislation that achieves certain budgetary goals.

1inwugi,Navigating the Balance of Power in the U.S. House and Senate to Drive Policy Wins,15,therosx,2,2025-02-12T17:46:43+00:00,"Following each election cycle, the real work begins for lobbying and public affairs professionals. As new leadership steps in, the legislative priorities shift and policy agendas are redefined in both the House and Senate. Government affairs professionals need to be able to quickly adapt their advocacy strategies to the evolving power dynamics and find the right opportunities to influence policy outcomes. Knowing the key players on Capitol Hill, including staff members and federal agency leadership working behind the scenes, is crucial to strategic planning and effective advocacy outcomes.

For lobbyists and other public affairs professionals navigating Capitol Hill, up-to-date, detailed congressional directories are an invaluable resource to identify and engage with the right decision-makers to advance policy goals. Bloomberg Government’s public affairs software offers comprehensive directories of members of Congress and their staff – updated daily so you’re always working with the most up-to-date information.

https://about.bgov.com/insights/public-affairs-solutions/congressional-directories

Below, we outline post-election strategies to help you prepare for shifting political dynamics in the House and Senate and share essential insights for optimizing advocacy and lobbying efforts.

**Which party currently controls Congress?**

The 2024 election has redefined the political landscape on Capitol Hill. With the Republican party securing control of the Senate and narrowing its majority in the House, the implications for policy making are significant.

These changes to the makeup of both the House and Senate set the stage for major shifts in committee leadership, legislative agendas, and public policy priorities. Congressional directories will be an essential tool to connect lobbyists and advocates with the congressional leaders shaping policy.

**Republicans maintain a slight majority in the House**

The Republican Party retains control of the House of Representatives, continuing their majority from the previous term. Republicans currently hold 218 seats while the Democrats have 215.

The balance of power in the House will likely change in January. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) resigned from Congress to become Trump’s national security adviser, and Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) is also set to resign if confirmed as ambassador to the UN. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) resigned from the 118th Congress and won’t take his seat in the 119th Congress.

This slim margin indicates a narrowly divided House, where coalition-building and bipartisan cooperation may be critical for passing legislation. For public affairs professionals, knowing which members hold key committee positions, where their legislative priorities lie, and how to reach the right staff in their office is crucial in such a finely balanced House. Congressional directories offer lobbyists the tools they need to navigate these legislative dynamics, helping you pinpoint those House members who may become pivotal swing votes in crucial policy debates.

**Republicans secure Senate control**

Wins in several close races in 2024 secured a Republican majority in the Senate of 53 seats to the Democrats’ 47 seats, including two independents who caucus with Democrats.

This new majority gives Senate Republicans the power to shape committee assignments and control over the Senate’s agenda, including budgetary and policy discussions that could have wide-ranging impact on industries from health care to energy. Staying informed about who leads the Senate’s key committees is essential to understand and influence policy direction.

**Which Senate seats flipped in the last election?**

Of the 33 Senate seats up for election in 2024, the Republican Party flipped four of them, securing their majority:

Montana: Tim Sheehy (R) defeated incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D).

Ohio: Bernie Moreno (R) defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D).

Pennsylvania: Dave McCormick (R) defeated incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D).

West Virginia: Jim Justice (R) defeated Glenn Elliott (D) to win the seat vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin.

No Republican Senate seats flipped to the Democratic Party in 2024.

**Building relationships with new members**

As newly elected members take office, they and their staff members are faced with the daunting task of translating campaign promises into tangible policies. Lobbyists and advocates can use congressional directories to identify fresh opportunities to reach out, introduce issues, and start relationships that may be pivotal.

Several key newly elected members of Congress will play important roles in the upcoming legislative session, including:

Val Hoyle (D) in Oregon’s 4th District and Josh Riley (D) in New York’s mid-Hudson Valley are among notable Democrats who won in competitive congressional districts.

John Manion (D) in Syracuse, New York, won his congressional race after benefitting from favorable redistricting in his district.

Ruben Gallego (D) held his Senate seat in Arizona, a state with increasing political importance.

**Identifying key policy allies and opponents**

Knowing where individual congressional members stand on issues helps in building coalitions or anticipating and countering opposition. Aligning lobbying and advocacy efforts with local economic and social interests can make a significant difference when targeting elected officials from specific regions or with localized constituency interests. Understanding the local nuances of issues is essential for professionals looking to influence the legislative agenda of elected officials who won tightly contested races.

For example, in 2024, Republicans extended electoral gains in Hispanic-majority areas of Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, showing a shifting demographic trend. And in certain states where President Donald Trump won in 2024, Democratic Senate candidates such as Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Alyssa Slotkin in Michigan managed to secure victories. Sen. Baldwin’s campaign outreach to Wisconsin’s dairy farmers helped her connect with a traditionally conservative constituency that might otherwise have leaned Republican. These results underscore the importance of localizing issues and policy positions.

**Key House committee leadership**

As Republicans retain control of the House, they will maintain leadership over key committees, including:

House Judiciary Committee: This is likely to be retained by current chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a vocal conservative with a focus on investigations and tech regulations.

House Oversight Committee: Having been committee chair since 2023, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) is expected to steer the committee’s focus toward scrutinizing executive policies.

House Ways and Means Committee: Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) is expected to take over chairmanship of the committee, potentially focusing on tax reform and budgetary oversight.

**Key Senate committee leadership**

With their newfound majority, Senate Republicans have assumed leadership of Senate committees, which will have significant implications for future lobbying and regulatory strategy. For example:

Senate Finance Committee: Committee Republicans have an influential role in shaping tax and health-care policies.

Senate Judiciary Committee: Committee leaders are focusing on judicial appointments and reforms, crucial for sectors such as technology and health care.

1imwivq,Vance out of the country ahead of Gabbard confirmation vote,35,therosx,5,2025-02-11T11:32:26+00:00,"Senate Republicans might need Vice President JD Vance to help confirm Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence — even as he’s out of the country for a series of previously scheduled events and meetings.

The Senate will vote to advance Gabbard’s nomination on Monday night with a final vote on confirmation expected around midnight Wednesday, assuming lawmakers don’t yield back any of the 30 hours of debate time.

Gabbard should be fine getting over Monday’s hurdle. Though Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) hasn’t announced if he will ultimately confirm her, he is expected to help advance her nomination on Monday night, his office said.

And while Republicans are increasingly confident Gabbard will get confirmed, Curtis as well as GOP Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are being closely watched as potential swing votes. McConnell previously helped advance Pete Hegseth’s Defense nomination before ultimately voting against confirming him.

If three Republicans oppose Gabbard — and no Democrats support her, as expected — she will need Vance to break a tie to help get her over the finish line.

The vice president is currently is in France for an AI summit and meetings with foreign leaders, and he is expected to be in Munich later this week.

1ie1lvz,Trump’s New Executive Order on Anti-Semitism,8,Sir-Matilda,4,2025-01-31T00:04:26+00:00,">President Trump has signed a new executive order to fight anti-Semitism. The key to its provenance and purpose is a series of events on Nov. 9, 2023, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

>That morning, a group called Coalition Against Apartheid organized and led a protest in one of the school’s main entry lobbies. This is against the rules, because high-foot-traffic areas are to be kept clear, for obvious safety reasons. Jewish and Israeli students showed up to form a counterprotest. MIT President Sally Kornbluth said officials “had serious concerns that it could lead to violence.”

>All protesters were told to leave the area or be suspended. Several refused to budge. When it came time to doling out the punishments, however, Kornbluth had second thoughts: “Because we later heard serious concerns about collateral consequences for the students, such as visa issues, we have decided, as an interim action, that the students who remained after the deadline will be suspended from non-academic campus activities. The students will remain enrolled at MIT and will be able to attend academic classes and labs.”

>There were two important acknowledgements in this statement. The first was that a not-insignificant portion of protest activists on campus were from outside the United States. The second was that foreign-born students were explicitly being given preferential treatment that American kids wouldn’t have been offered. The school did not dispute the fact that these students broke the rules; the administration simply decided that because they might be deported, they’d be spared that punishment.

>That context made one part of Trump’s new executive order almost inevitable:

>“In addition to identifying relevant authorities to curb or combat anti-Semitism generally required by this section, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with each other, shall include in their reports recommendations for familiarizing institutions of higher education with the grounds for inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3) so that such institutions may monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff relevant to those grounds and for ensuring that such reports about aliens lead, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to investigations and, if warranted, actions to remove such aliens.”

>That law says that those in terrorist groups or organizations that “espouse” terrorism are inadmissible, and so too is anyone who “endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.”

>It’s a call, essentially, to remind universities of existing law and nudge them to comply with it. The MIT protest is a case in point: Administrators didn’t apply the rules equally because they didn’t like what the law said might happen to perpetrators. This created a special class of student: one who supports terrorism against Jews was going to have unique immunity. It’s just one way these campuses have created environments that openly incentivize anti-Jewish harassment.

>Unequal treatment under the law has been at the center of this entire controversy. Jewish students’ civil rights under Title VI have been violated at will on campuses that accept federal funds or are themselves public institutions.

>Speaking of Title VI, the executive order begins by referencing an order Trump signed in 2019, the purpose of which was to ensure those civil-rights protections were applied to Jewish students on campus. That’s why there isn’t all that much that’s new about the recent order: The administration is trying to foreclose avenues of noncompliance that schools have been using, with the blessing of the previous administration, to violate Jewish rights.

>Institutions seemingly don’t know how to protect Jews’ civil rights, so Trump is spelling it out for them. Elsewhere in the new order, the president suggests the attorney general should make use of a statute known as the “conspiracy against rights” prohibition. This post-Civil War law was designed to address white supremacist groups preventing black Americans from exercising their political rights. (Trump himself was charged under the statute in one of his Jan. 6-related cases.)

>In fact, the masked “globalize the intifada” mobs are quite natural heirs to the Ku Klux Klan, and laws enacted to curb their power are a logical source of ideas for those who actually want to crack down on the post-Oct. 7 goon squads using violence or intimidation to negate the constitutional rights of Jewish students.

>The Trump administration is making it very simple for those who want to fight anti-Semitism within existing law. We’re about to find out which institutions oppose the very idea of equal enforcement of the law.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1ie1lvz/trumps_new_executive_order_on_antisemitism/,Tuesday,0.59,,False
1idzr5o,Air Traffic Control and the DEI Debate | National Review,0,Sir-Matilda,7,2025-01-30T22:40:54+00:00,">As Charlie notes, even after last night’s air disaster culminated a series of near-misses over the past four years, American air travel remains astonishingly safe, and the likelihood is that a full investigation will find that last night’s crash of an Army Blackhawk helicopter into a commercial airliner was (1) a total freak accident, (2) the result of a mechanical problem with the helicopter, and/or (3) human error by the helicopter pilot, perhaps compounded by poor air-traffic control. Efforts to blame this on Donald Trump, whose transportation secretary Sean Duffy only took office yesterday morning, say more about the people pointing fingers than about the actual causes of the tragedy.

>All that being said, it’s worth noting here as the inevitable hurdy-gurdy cranks into gear that Trump has actually moved to fix a problem with how we hire air-traffic controllers, in order to reorient it toward hiring the best people in order to make air-traffic control safer. The Biden administration was sued last year over this:

>>From 1989 to 2013, the Collegiate Training Initiative program was a pipeline to a career in air traffic control. The program aimed to ensure future air traffic controllers had the skills and knowledge necessary to carry out the job. More than ten years ago, the Obama Administration scrapped 1000 qualified candidates. The administration’s justification was that the pool of applicants was not diverse enough, so they would be purged from consideration. Instead of hiring candidates with the most competency, individuals were elevated for hiring consideration based on their race…I, along with Mountain States Legal Foundation, am litigating a class action lawsuit on behalf of more than 900 prospective air traffic controllers who studied, took the pre-employment exam, and passed the test with flying colors but were dismissed because of their skin color. Our lawsuit seeks justice for all air traffic control candidates who chose this career, dedicated their lives and education to it, and were summarily denied a job for no reason other than the color of their skin. In a system with only 14,000 air traffic controllers, purging a thousand of the next generation’s best and brightest was irresponsible and unsustainable.

>Trump’s January 22 executive order aimed to end the discriminatory hiring practices that triggered the lawsuit:

>>President Donald J. Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum terminating a Biden Administration Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) hiring policy that prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over safety and efficiency:

>> * This Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Transportation and FAA Administrator to immediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring.

> * >It also requires the FAA Administrator to review the past performance and performance standards of all FAA employees in critical safety positions and make clear that any individual who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensure Americans’ flight safety and efficiency. . . .

>> * Almost unbelievably, as a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative, the Biden FAA specifically recruited and hired individuals with “severe intellectual” disabilities, psychiatric issues, and complete paralysis over other individuals who sought to work for the FAA.

>> * President Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely on ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence.

>Good luck arguing in the immediate aftermath of a fatal air crash that hiring for excellence in air-traffic control is a bad idea.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1idzr5o/air_traffic_control_and_the_dei_debate_national/,Tuesday,0.33,,False

1hvhtl5,Future of the book club,19,coldnorthwz,9,2025-01-07T03:07:15+00:00,"Hi everyone, I want to talk about the future of the book club before we try starting anything for this year.

I need to know the interest in continuing the book club. Last year for about half the year or so it was only me participating, and I wasn't doing very well at that since I was under a pretty heavy load with other things going on at the same time. This meant I was behind more often than not from July onward.

I don't like it being the coldnorthwz show, and its not as fun as when there is other participation. If it does continue, I think we will need to reduce the pace/number of books overall since I don't foresee myself having a lighter load than last fall (second semester of Grad school, still have quite a few other projects going on irl). We could also look at changing the format, maybe book club threads are bi-weekly or once a month and cover a different amount of material.

I need to know if there will be other participation or not. We do have a list of books, but not a definitive schedule, so if we don't continue the book club I will release the list of books at the least.

Last post from the last years book club is here: [Final Book Club Post of the Year : r/tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1hgs5j6/final_book_club_post_of_the_year/)

Wall Street Journal.",9,JustKidding456,1,2024-12-25T07:07:41+00:00,"> When Saul of Tarsus set out on his journey to Damascus the whole of the known world lay in bondage. There was one state, and it was Rome. There was one master for it all, and he was Tiberius Caesar.
> 
> Everywhere there was civil order, for the arm of the Roman law was long. Everywhere there was stability, in government and in society, for the centurions saw that it was so.
> 
> But everywhere there was something else, too. There was oppression—for those who were not the friends of Tiberius Caesar. There was the tax gatherer to take the grain from the fields and the flax from the spindle to feed the legions or to fill the hungry treasury from which divine Caesar gave largess to the people. There was the impressor to find recruits for the circuses. There were executioners to quiet those whom the Emperor proscribed. What was a man for but to serve Caesar?
> 
> There was the persecution of men who dared think differently, who heard strange voices or read strange manuscripts. There was enslavement of men whose tribes came not from Rome, disdain for those who did not have the familiar visage. And most of all, there was everywhere a contempt for human life. What, to the strong, was one man more or less in a crowded world?
> 
> Then, of a sudden, there was a light in the world, and a man from Galilee saying, Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.
> 
> And the voice from Galilee, which would defy Caesar, offered a new Kingdom in which each man could walk upright and bow to none but his God. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. And he sent this gospel of the Kingdom of Man into the uttermost ends of the earth.
> 
> So the light came into the world and the men who lived in darkness were afraid, and they tried to lower a curtain so that man would still believe salvation lay with the leaders.
> 
> But it came to pass for a while in divers places that the truth did set man free, although the men of darkness were offended and they tried to put out the light. The voice said, Haste ye. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you, for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
> 
> Along the road to Damascus the light shone brightly. But afterward Paul of Tarsus, too, was sore afraid. He feared that other Caesars, other prophets, might one day persuade men that man was nothing save a servant unto them, that men might yield up their birthright from God for pottage and walk no more in freedom.
> 
> Then might it come to pass that darkness would settle again over the lands and there would be a burning of books and men would think only of what they should eat and what they should wear, and would give heed only to new Caesars and to false prophets. Then might it come to pass that men would not look upward to see even a winter’s star in the East, and once more, there would be no light at all in the darkness.
> 
> And so Paul, the apostle of the Son of Man, spoke to his brethren, the Galatians, the words he would have us remember afterward in each of the years of his Lord:
> 
> Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1hlvv5i/royster_vermont_1949_in_hoc_anno_domini_editorial/,Tuesday,0.77,,False

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

As of writing this post, here’s where we’re at. 

State - Marco Rubio

DoD - Pete Hegseth

AG - Matt Gaetz

DHS - Kristi Noem

EPA - Lee Zeldin

DNI - Tulsi Gabbard 

UN - Elise Stefanik

CIA - John Ratcliffe

As usual with Trump, we’ll see if these stick long enough to make it to their office. Additionally watching for whether or not the incoming Senate Majority Leader (Thune - SD) will signal support for Trumps desire to make recess appointments.

1gjwamd,Choices have consequences,19,coldnorthwz,18,2024-11-05T02:24:03+00:00,"**If Kamala loses:**

It's funny to see stuff about how the question, if Trump wins (I think it's probably 55/45 at this point), will be ""should the democrats have replaced Biden"" when they were screwed before this point. They were screwed at the point when Joe Biden incepted the idea of running again for a second term even though he is over 80, looking and acting absolutely ancient. The public, even though they gave him the presidency, were concerned about this in *2020.* The polling showed Americans believed this regardless of party and that Biden shouldn't run again, but then he did. He ran into June, and then held on for a month after the disaster on stage.

This caused the party to lock in Harris as the new candidate, even though there were some thoughts of having an open primary, because of the affects it would have since there was a good risk it would be ugly and the fact that we campaign finance reformed our way into possibly having locked the resources that Biden-Harris had raised to one of the two on the ticket. It was a lot of resources too.

If we are being honest with ourselves, Harris would not have made it through a primary had Joe Biden not run which would be better for the Democrats because she is intimately tied to the Administration and its policies and incumbents are currently unpopular (fortunately for them *someone else* is also unpopular). She is in a position where she has to be mostly a team player and defend what came before (I give a lot of leeway to VPs on being a team player, did for Pence too. It's why I don't care all that much about whether or not she knew, or when she started to know, that Biden was having problems). She also would not have backtracked anywhere near as much on the Progressive nonsense had she had to run in a primary, not that she has answered for the fact *she did backtrack* and why we should believe anything she says about policy position (those that we know of not being any good anyway). She is an absolutely terrible public speaker and campaigner.

Specifically, if Harris loses Pennsylvania because Josh Shapiro ~~is a Jew~~ ""had a bad interview"" its going to be viewed as a major mistake. She needs Pennsylvania to win and the margins are tiny there. She was winning Minnesota regardless.

Which goes back to why is Kamala VP anyway if she isn't very good? Progressive identity politics severely narrowed the field of possible picks. Not a whole lot of other options there based on what we know about her selection. Also, VPs don't really matter, right?

At least we won't have the terrible policy proposals that were laid out, the continued fluffing of Iran, and whatever sideshow circus the 250th anniversary celebrations of America would be.

**If Trump loses:**

Should have been obvious from a mile away. Everyone capable is gone and Trump surrounded himself with crackpots, grifters, Democrats, and literally anyone that excessively flatters him. Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek, the looniest Kenedy, Laura Loomer, and Tucker Carlson. Endorsing Dr Oz, Hershel Walker, and Kari Lake amongst others should have been a flashing warning sign. These were the picks he made either on his own or with advice from the type of people that surrounded him after January 6th, which is probably why his picks weren't quite as bad before 2021. Speaking of picks, JD Vance was a major blunder. He believed that Joe Biden and he were alike, he simply could not imagine that Biden might put some conception of the greater good before himself because to Trump there is no greater good than Trump. So, he picked Vance because he didn't need to quell the concerns of conservatives or moderate Republicans. Vance will do whatever Trump wants him to do from how embarrassing himself to ignoring constitutional provisions, the latter of which was something conservatives and moderate Republicans wouldn't do as we saw with Pence. Vance is popular with the online twitter and reddit right, but that has had the consequence of a whole lot of baggage and saying some really stupid things. How much of what he says he actually believes (something that can be said of a lot of the types surrounding Trump) is very much in question.

Who knows what Trump believes, if anything at all. There are only really 3 things that seem relatively consistent: 1) that he isn't constrained by law or the constitution, 2) a usually hardline on immigration, and 3) that tariffs are a magical silver bullet that can do anything and everything (even though the only economists that agree are the fringe nut cases similar to the ones the Dems pull out when they want to do something stupid like wealth taxes).

Actual policy wise, as far as can be made out, is to crater revenue while vastly increasing deficit spending, weakening the country on the world stage (possibly attempting to return the country to some form of isolationism. I'm not sure Vance or Trump see or understand any interest beyond our shores. Dems are bad on foreign policy but at least it's usually just folly and not complete suicide), and massive tariffs which will vastly increase prices on *everything*. We shouldn't underestimate the chance that there are shoddy ""investigations"" to ""prove"" this or that conspiracy theory, especially around the 2020 election. He may try to use government power against his personal enemies (which are all across the political spectrum at this point), which crosses into the type of tyranny that the founders were concerned about.

But there isn't really any policy other than that, its just whatever nonsense he thinks is popular or is throwing at the wall at any moment in time because Trump doesn't really have any beliefs, certainly vanishingly few conservative ones, and everything will be left to whoever he delegates to or whoever is the last person to talk to him. None if it will have much continuity with historical conservatism because Trump isn't a conservative, he's basically a Progressive.

At least the right-wing Progressivism he represents may see its popularity wane or die (essentially loosing since 2016 will wake some people up), the suicidal foreign policy, the rough price increases caused by the tariffs, the deficits that possibly could potentially be larger than what Kamala would have, and whatever loony nonsense he would try to pull as president would be. While it has been forgotten amongst his most fervent supporters, he was an incompetent moron from 2016 (when I did vote for him, it was his incompetence that soured me on him initially) to 2020 and I don't see any indication this would be better from 2024 to 2028, especially with who is going to staff his administration (I wrote almost all of this about 2 weeks ago and in that time it seems like he may give RFK jr public health, a further reiteration of the point).

**America loses:**

We are absolutely hosed if this is the candidates we produce as a country for president. Insolvency of major government programs aren't getting further away and there is no real plan to fix them because they can be demagogued right up until the insolvency happens because there are only 2 options to fix them: 1) Reduce benefits or 2) vastly increase taxes on *everyone*. Probably a combination of both. Neither of which are popular.

Our foreign policy has gone in the trash and we aren't taking seriously the military threats that we are about to encounter, especially in Asia, and I don't think anyone has a real plan on winning any such conflict nor do I trust either of the two candidates to be able to. America, and the west in general, have become extremely weak willed and I'm not sure public opinion would survive the loss of an Aircraft carrier with most of its compliment going with her based on how much whining there was about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, or with the wars currently in Ukraine and Israel. Any war we fight will be far deadlier and more costly than any since at least Vietnam.

Economically we have pulled greatly ahead of basically everyone, especially Europe which used to be closer to us, but it seems like all the plans around the economy are designed to destroy our advantage. Left wing economic talk is basically a variety of conspiracy theories with the ideal end to punish anyone that is successful, and regulation designed to quash innovation. The Progressive right's economics is vast meddling and picking winers and losers, wrecking up both imports and exports in the process, and it also is getting somewhat conspiratorial in its thinking. All so the rust belt doesn't get any, or very few manufacturing jobs anyway. Why put a factory in Ohio or Michigan when you can put it in the South where no one is beholden to the leaches that are the unions? It's all going to be very automated either way.",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1gjwamd/choices_have_consequences/,Tuesday,0.65,Meta Thread,False

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

I assumed the cost would fall to boosters and targeted alumni donations to athletic departments.  Tennessee is apparently tacking on an NIL fee for ticket sales now (including student tickets if I read correctly).   This feels dangerously close to raising tuition to support sports programs, which seems like the cart leading the horse.

There's been some good NIL discussion here in the past,  but I won't be offended if the mods delete this for being too off-topic.

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

1ec57lb,Thoughts on the federal bureaucracy/administrative state? ,6,duke_awapuhi,21,2024-07-25T20:32:30+00:00,"Hi All. I was curious about what people in here think about the federal bureaucracy or administrative state in the US. With conservative think tanks proposing an overhaul to this system in a way that I assume many people in here would find too extreme or radical, I’m wondering what reforms you guys might prefer. Do you think the bureaucracy is corrupt? Do you think it’s fiscally wasteful? If you want reforms in this area what problems do you see and do you have proposals for fixing them? I hope I’m not asking “leading questions”, but I’d like to respectfully gauge where this community’s heads are at.

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

Can He Convince You? | National Review,18,coldnorthwz,3,2024-06-17T21:12:26+00:00,">I was far more interested in Vance’s response, near the end of the interview, to Douthat’s questioning on the matter of January 6. For this is where he visibly hiccups, betraying an intellectual gag reflex that makes the witting intellectual compromises he’s cramming down that much more difficult for him to swallow. He argues that Trump’s railing about a stolen election was justified because the 2020 election really was rigged by the media and the deep state: “The argument is basically that there were a host of institutional actors, technology companies, various forms of censorship, that mobilized in 2020 in a way that they hadn’t in 2016. . . . That was a way in which the basic democratic will of America was obstructed.” Douthat presses him further: Yes, the media playing field was tilted, so whine all you want and feel like it was stolen, but what about the actual attempts to overturn the election? The votes themselves were valid and properly counted, so why cross the Rubicon? The legal filings in court, the internal pressure campaign on Mike Pence to get him to reject electoral slates?

>Vance’s answer is so shockingly unconvincing that, after reading an entire interview during which he has successfully humanized himself, readers will suddenly feel that ice-cold chill of recognition, the moment when you can see someone counterfeiting himself in public:
......
......
......
There is much more — again, read it. Vance, if I understand him correctly, advances the theory that because Trump pursued his plans to overturn the election stupidly, it doesn’t “really count” — incompetence as a defense. (“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury: This man hired both Sidney Powell and Lin Wood to represent him. He had Jeffrey Clark running his inside game. Does that count as a serious attempt to overturn the election? Really, now?”)",https://reddit.com/r/tuesday/comments/1di95qd/j_d_vance_hasnt_convinced_himself_yet_can_he/,Tuesday,0.92,,False

1dbmjz4,Starbucks: Is trouble brewing at the coffee giant?,19,Ihaveaboot,14,2024-06-09T05:43:24+00:00,"

I think this BBC writer is reaching.   Guessing it's an intern.

They conclude with this:

> And while Maria Giorgia remains a regular customer, the 17-year-old says her perception of the firm has shifted.
>""It used to be cool in middle school. Now it's just convenient.""

Maybe I'm just grumpy tonight, but what middle schoolers should be drinking coffee, let alone spending $6 per cup?  Why is the author primarily using young teens as their sources for a F500 company financial issue?   

Yeah, I'm grumpy.   This type of reporting infuriates me.

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

1cnfxqr,Our Nation Does Not Take Civic Education or Obligation Seriously - We're Seeing the Fruits of that Now,45,AnglicanEp,23,2024-05-08T21:28:38+00:00,"This is my attempt at an ""effort post"". I hope you folks enjoy it and find it somewhat valuable.

  
American democracy has seen a rapid expansion over the past century or so. With the end of the indirect election of senators and the rise of the primary system for choosing nominees, the power of the average Joe voter is at it's zenith. While in the past our system had numerous guardrails in place to ward against the power of populists and demagogues, now those guardrails have largely been dismantled and left by the wayside. Now, in the era of populism that has predictably followed, we must ask ourselves how we can begin to restore sanity and intelligent discussion to our politics. The answer lies in this: as ones rights expand, so must their obligations.

While the power of the median voter has grown significantly over the past century or so, their associated obligations have not. The only civic obligations that most people are all that familiar with are paying taxes and casting votes. That's what many are taught is expected from them if they are to be good citizens. Yet, simply telling people to ""get out the vote"" is only half of what is necessary. While American citizens may have a right to vote, they also have an obligation to ensure that they cast informed, educated votes. All too often, Americans cast votes out of partisanship and anger, on the basis of misinformation or even ignorance. In a time when our Republic is struggling to remain healthy and maintain some sense of reasonableness, perhaps we should begin to tell our citizens that they have an obligation to vote \*only\* if they have done their homework first and that, if they have not, they have an obligation to stay home. 

However, I doubt that such a thing would do much good at the end of the day. Many people view casting a vote in ignorance as a God given right and they will never accept an obligation to do otherwise. Thus, the best way to address this issue is through education. It's long past time to put civic education at the forefront of both public and private education. For too long, we have told generations of children that education is only so useful as it can be said to increase one's income. STEM has been placed on a pedestal as those subjects are often the ones that deliver the best ROI for college students in a time of astronomical tuition fees. While this may make sense on the individual level if one is considering only their own finances, it makes less sense for society as a whole. When children exit high school with little to no real knowledge of how we actually govern ourselves and perhaps even less appreciation for the great achievements of our system, it makes them all the more susceptible to charlatans that wish to sell them populist fantasies of massively expanded welfare programs, isolationist foreign policy, never ending trillion dollar deficits, and election denial.

No, this cannot be allowed to continue. If we are to embue the American voter with expanded rights and power, we must also ensure that they are up to the task of managing such things. While STEM is useful and should still be encouraged, it should not come at the cost of raising educated, informed, and politically mature citizens who have the knowledge and temperament necessary to wield such great influence over our beloved Republic. The Donald Trump's of the world depend on there being a sizeable chunk of the electorate that is ready and willing to accept and tolerate their lies, misrepresentations, deceptions, and half-baked ""plans"". Cut off this core source of support by endowing our citizens with proper critical thinking skills and a thorough civic education, and the age of demagoguery will soon be at it's end. We need, more than ever, to understand that education is not just useful as a tool for raising individual incomes or even for generating economic growth, but that it is absolutely vital to the health of our Republic, especially as the power of the median voter grows every decade. 

A Republic if you can keep it, indeed.

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

As a book club tie in, we are currently reading The Shah. The chapters are short and we only do 1 per week, so I suggest picking up the book and joining in. It takes me half an hour to 45 minutes to read the chapter and write up my thoughts for the week.

I intend to do 3 foreign policy based questions at least: This one, one on Russia (also part of our current reading and highly relevant to what is happening today), and one on China.

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

Perhaps I'm being overly sentimental, but I've always considered Boeing an iconic, stallwart American company (in war and peace) for the past century.

The 737 Max issues have me wondering wtf is going on over there right now.

The US department of defense obviously has a huge stake in what is happening with Boeing, as does the FAA.

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

In 1951, Banfield published Government Project, an account of the U.S. government’s attempt to remake the lives of some of its citizens by establishing a cooperative farm in Arizona during the Great Depression. The project didn’t go so well, and Kevin believes it holds vital lessons about the limits of government planning that Americans across the political spectrum would be wise to recall today.

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc...

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!

/r/tuesday is a political discussion sub for the right side of the political spectrum - from the center to the traditional/standard right (but not alt-right!) However, we're going for a big tent approach and welcome anyone with nuanced and non-standard views. We encourage dissents and discourse as long as it is accompanied with facts and evidence and is done in good faith and in a polite and respectful manner.

##PURPOSE OF THE DISCUSSION THREAD

Like in r/neoliberal and r/neoconnwo, you can talk about anything you want in the Discussion Thread. So, socialize with other people, talk about politics and conservatism, tell us about your day, shitpost or literally anything under the sun. In the DT, rules such as ""stay on topic"" and ""no Shitposting/Memes/Politician-focused comments"" don't apply.

It is my hope that we can foster a sense of community through the Discussion Thread. 

##IMAGE FLAIRS

r/Tuesday will reward image flairs to people who write an effort post or an OC text post on certain subjects. It could be about philosophy, politics, economics, etc... Available image flairs can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tuesday/wiki/flairs). If you have any special requests for specific flairs, please message the mods!
